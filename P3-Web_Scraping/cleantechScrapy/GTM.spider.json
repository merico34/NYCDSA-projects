{"body": " Module prices are at historic lows and global solar installations reached an all-time high in 2016. How does this influence the purchasing decisions of residential solar installers? Allison Mond, GTM Research solar analyst and author ofModule Procurement Trends in the U.S. Residential Market, explains. GTM: How are falling module prices impacting solar module procurement decisions? Allison Mond:The impact is subtle, but significant. Installers have always managed ongoing relationships with multiple module manufacturers and distributors at one time in order to ensure that they can execute on attractive pricing opportunities as they arise. This is even more important now as module prices are falling so quickly, and installers want to keep their own costs low in order to stay competitive. Installers are looking for module manufacturers who can be flexible on pricing and stay in line with the rest of the market. GTM: Beyond price, what other factors are residential installers looking for when procuring modules? AM: The bankability and staying power of module brands are important to all installers. Installers want to ensure that the module brands they use in installations will be around for a long time and can fulfill their warranty obligations. Therefore, it's important for installers to keep an eye on the financial health of module manufacturers, especially given the way that currently low module prices are squeezing module manufacturers margins. GTM: In your research, did you find differences in how national and local installers make module procurement decisions? AM: There is a wide variation in the module brands used by large and small installers. While the most important factor in the module procurement decision for large installers appears to be price, smaller installers put more weight on additional factors such as panel efficiency and warranty. This is reflected in the panels most widely used by different groups of installers. Trina is the module brand most frequently used by large installers, with approximately 20 percent of the market, while SolarWorld is the most popular brand with small installers, also with about one-fifth of that market. GTM: As the market continues to move away from leases and toward loans, is it having an effect on module procurement? AM: The relationship between ownership structure (customer-owned versus third-party-owned) and module brand depends on the installer. In general, customer-owned systems employ a higher proportion of premium panels than do third-party-owned systems. For instance, among mid-size installers, SunPower panels are the most widely used panels for direct-owned systems, at 35 percent.Hanwha Q CELLS panels are the most widely used in third-party-owned systems, at 27 percent. At the installer level, however, this pattern does not always hold true. GTM: Given these trends between installer size and financing and module procurement, how do you expect the landscape among module suppliers to change in 2017? AM:Spurred in part by the growth in direct ownership, we're seeing local and regional installers gain market share over the national public companies. In turn, the premium module brands that these local and regional installers primarily use, will gain market share as well.

{"body": " Even some of President Donald Trumps fiercest critics admit that his election win was largely due to his ability to connect on a visceral level with voters who had long felt ignored and disrespected. Whether it was his unscripted, often rambling speeches or his zest for politically incorrect barbs, Trump made many of his supporters believe that he genuinely understood their priorities and values. But there is growing evidence that -- at least when it comes to clean energy -- there is a wide chasm between the policy positions the president supports and what many of his Republican supporters actually believe. Throughout the campaign, Trump ignored clean energy and focused mostly on promoting coal, oil and gas. But as reputable political surveys have shown, Republican votersactually want more support of renewable energy over fossil fuels. And they are proving that with their wallets, too. That is one of the most intriguing findings in a new study by PowerScout, an Oakland-based company that uses data to assist consumers who are considering going solar. PowerScout examined about 1.5 million rooftops in the top 20 solar markets nationwide and found that Democratic and Republican party donors installed residential solar systems at roughly equal rates -- 3.06 percent of Democratic donors and 2.24 percent of Republicans, respectively. In California, by far the nations largest residential solar market, Republicans and Democrats install solar at about the same clip, while in Hawaii Republicans install more solar than Democrats. The timing of the studys release to coincide with Trumps inauguration was not an accident. We want to put a stake in the ground and send a message to the incoming administration, to President Trump and to Secretary Perry, to show in a data-driven way that this is not a partisan issue, said Attila Toth, the CEO and co-founder of PowerScout, who formerly ran SunEdisons distributed generation business. With this household-level data, you can show there is a real economic-driven, non-partisan demand for this type of clean energy asset. PowerScouts study is not the only research to expose the wide clean energy divide between some Republican politicians and the partys most ardent supporters. Last September, the energy information company SolarPulse released a studythat examined data from 25,000 California homes that had installed solar between 1997 and 2015, finding that Republican-leaning communities were five times more likely to purchase rooftop solar than were communities that voted for Democrats. A 2016 poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication also found that 84 percent of all registered voters, including 75 percent of Republicans, supported additional funding for clean energy sources like wind and solar. PowerScouts study was different from past research in two significant ways. Rather than studying the voting patterns and partisanship of geographic areas with relatively large amounts of installed solar, the company zoomed in on the household level. In other words, it wanted to find out how willing individual Democrats and Republicans were to shell out money for a solar installation. In addition, the study examined the homes of 1.5 million rooftops -- a robust dataset. To reach its findings, PowerScout pulled the Federal Election Commissions lists of donors to the Democratic and Republican parties and candidates in the top 20 solar markets. Toth felt that focusing on donors was the best gauge available for an individual households party affiliation. We have seen studies before that lump people together by the voting preference of a county where they reside. To us, that is not granular enough to explain someones political tendencies, he said. If someone forks out money, that shows their political leaning at the household level. From those publicly available lists of donors, PowerScout then filtered out work addresses, post office boxes and apartments so it could focus on single-family homes where a residential solar system could be installed. After winnowing the initial donor lists down, PowerScout was left with 1.5 million homes, 1 million of which were Democratic donors and the rest of which were Republican supporters. In order to get the household-level data it desired, PowerScout next gathered satellite images of all 1.5 million homes of Democratic and Republican donors. Naturally, it would be too time-consuming and cumbersome to have people search each rooftop for solar panels, so the company instead employed a machine-learning model called a convolutional neural network, or CNN. We went through and labeled images of houses that had solar and those that didnt, said Mike Ulin, head of data science at PowerScout. You feed those into the model, and the model, based on those examples, can learn to differentiate between homes with solar and without solar. The model isnt actually looking at all the images, at least as we would imagine it. Instead, it converts each image into numerical values. So every pixel in the image has three values, a different number for every red, green and blue channel. You end up with a model that has millions of variables as opposed to simple regression models that only have a handful, said Ulin. In addition, Ulin said he optimized the model through a technique known as gradient descent. The model goes through hundreds of iterations to find the optimal settings for millions of variables. Every time it does, we score the output and how well the model identifies the labeled images, he said, noting that the model was about 90 percent accurate at identifying images. Toth said the technology can be used to identify the people who are most likely to purchase clean energy technologies like solar and substantially cut customer-acquisition costs. You can build a propensity model that helps you to focus marketing dollars on high-propensity customers, he said. With more data and smarter marketing, Toth believes that, over time, customer acquisition costs can be sliced sixfold. Today, solar customer acquisition costs are in excess of 15 percent to 17 percent of the total purchase price, he said, comparing those costs with the 3 percent to 4 percent average in the car industry. Theres no reason you should pay $6,000 to acquire a solar system [customer] when the hardware is costing less than that. If those cost reductions come to fruition, its safe to say that solar will become even less of a partisan issue than it is now.", "theme": "Markets & Policy", "title": "Republican Political Donors Install Nearly as Much Solar as Democratic Donors", "comments": "2", "tags": ["democrats", "powerscout", "republicans", "rooftop solar"]}
{"body": " Reuters:UK Offshore Wind Costs Fall by Nearly a Third in Four Years The cost of producing electricity from wind farms off the coast of Britain has fallen 32 percent in the past four years, meeting a government target four years early, an industry report released on Tuesday said. Britain plans to increase its offshore wind capacity to help bridge a looming electricity supply gap as old nuclear plants and coal-fired power stations close. Offshore wind farm costs fell to an average of 97 pounds ($120.82) per megawatt-hour (MWh) in the 2015-2016 financial year, from 142 pounds/MWh four years earlier, the report commissioned by the Offshore Wind Program Board said.

In fact, CEO Elon Musk revealed in a tweet that Full Self-Driving features could come as early as three months from now. Musk didnt indicate specifically what portion of Teslas Full Self-Driving Capability will be made available in three to six months' time, but we do know that the software update will activate all eight surround cameras on the vehicle as opposed to only four needed by Enhanced Autopilot. Jalopnik:NASA's Forgotten Electric Car From 1979 Is Utterly Fascinating I have a friend who is unusually good at salvaging crap. Just this weekend he found, in an abandoned house, a perfect rear bumper (and brackets!) for my Beetle. Thats amazing enough, but he also found a set of NASA documents from the 1970s. Surprisingly, one of those volumes had, of all things, some fascinating information about a largely forgotten NASA electric car project. Reading about that car, its amazing how far the technology and the perception of electric cars has come. The volume itself is a record of the 1979 NASA Authorization hearings before the Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications. Of course, its full of interesting stuff -- this was the period when the Space Shuttle was being completed, and NASA was still hoping to get it flying in time to help save Skylab -- but what really caught my eye was this little picture of a strange little car.

{"body": " Utility Dive: Trump Election Throws Wrench in California ISO Plan for Western Power Market California's plan for a regionalized power market was already on hold due to concerns over governance, but despite a positive reception from other states, the election of Donald Trump has made officials wary of moving forward. Politico reports Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead has indicated any agreement on a regional power market would have to wait until President-elect Trump takes office and determines which way he will move on energy policy. This summer, California Gov. Jerry Brown paused the California Independent System Operator's plans to expand the existing Western Energy Imbalance Market into a full ISO, citing governance concerns and the potential setbacks to California's emissions goals. The concept of a regionalized power market was a complicated matter to begin with. California and other participants of the Western EIM have been mulling plans to integrate into a full organized market, but those efforts are on hold over uncertainty as to who would run the ISO. Trump's election last month has muddied the waters further, with concerns that a regional market that seemed doable on one day could come under attack from federal authorities the next. Reuters: Saudi Aramco, GE to Launch Saudi Arabia's First Wind Turbine Next Month Saudi Aramco plans to commission its wind turbine pilot project, the first in the kingdom, next month, the state oil company said on Sunday, part of nationwide plans to diversify energy supplies and to meet an increase in demand. The wind turbine, supplied by U.S. company General Electric (GE), will provide power to Saudi Aramcos bulk plant in Turaif, in northwest Saudi Arabia. \"The first electricity is expected to be supplied to the Saudi Aramco bulk plant once commissioning of the wind turbine is completed in January 2017,\" Aramco said in a statement. Pacific Business News: Hawaii Energy Co-Op Moves Closer to Possible Utility Takeover  The Hawaii Island Energy Cooperative has moved a big step closer to becoming an operating nonprofit utility serving the Big Island, one of its directors confirmed to Pacific Business News Monday. HIEC was recently granted tax exempt nonprofit status by the Internal Revenue Service, joining the 900-plus member-owned, community-based businesses serving 42 million energy customers across the U.S., including the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC). This is particularly important, as both [Hawaii Electric Light Co.] and [Hawaiian Electric Co.] roll out new electric rate increases, Marco Mangelsdorf, director and spokesperson for HIEC, said. Cost control and efficiency are core to a cooperative, not shareholder profits. Mangelsdorf also noted that the Hawaii Public Utilities Commissions recent rejection of NextEra Energy Inc.s proposed $4.3 billion acquisition of Hawaiian Electric opens the door for other utility ownership options, including co-op models like HIEC and KIUC. HIEC has said that it could save Big Island ratepayers up to $234 million if HELCO is converted to a nonprofit cooperative. Environmental Progress: An Open Letter on Nuclear Energy to President-Elect Donald Trump and Governor Rick Perry We are writing as scientists, economists, conservationists and citizens to urge you to take strong action to save and grow Americas nuclear energy sector. Nuclear power plants in the U.S. are struggling against cheap natural gas, heavily subsidized renewables and low electricity demand. At the same time, global demand for electricity is set to rise 70 percent in 25 years thanks to the rise of energy-hungry developing nations around the world. CNBC (commentary): Trump's War on Washington Starts With These Battles  President-elect Donald Trump looks more and more like he's preparing an invasion force to change Washington as we know it. But wars need battles and, more specifically, battle plans. With every new cabinet appointment, tweet, interview, and speech on his victory tour, Trump is doubling down on putting together a team and pursuing policies that slay Washington's bipartisan sacred cows. That's right, I said \"bipartisan.\" You might think American politics are hopelessly divided along partisan lines, but Trump keeps proving that to be untrue because of the bipartisan angry responses to so many of his transition period moves and comments. Critics from both sides of the aisle have bashed aspects of Trump's very personal negotiations with Carrier to keep American jobs in the U.S. They responded with public concern and alarm to Trump's comments about breaking the \"One China\" policy and the longtime practice of presidents getting daily intelligence briefings. As of now, at least four of Trump's official choices have signaled very clearly what kinds of smaller government policies they'll tackle first. We know Secretary of Health and Human Services-Designate Tom Price is going to pursue the repeal of Obamacare and work with Republicans in Congress to create a viable replacement policy that puts more responsibility in the hands of individual Americans to buy their own health coverage. And Energy Secretary-Designate Rick Perry is on record as saying he thinks the Energy Department should be shut down. Downsizing the DOE is pretty much a certainty. EPA Blog: Update on Clean Power Plan Model Rules States, cities, businesses, tribes, and other organizations across the country are taking important steps to cut carbon pollution from power plants. In fact, power plant carbon emissions in 2015 were almost 25 percent below 2005 levels. Our extensive public engagement highlighted this continued progress and helped us ensure that the Clean Power Plan (CPP) was in line with the transition that is under way in the electricity sector. Our outreach also made it clear that states were looking to the agency to continue providing support and tools, including the Model Rules, that would help them in developing or expanding programs and strategies to cut carbon pollution. EPA proposed the Model Rules in August 2015 when we issued the final CPP. The proposed Model Rules highlighted straightforward pathways to adopting a trading system, making it easy for states and power plants to use emissions trading to reduce carbon pollution. Today, we are withdrawing the draft Model Rules and accompanying draft documents from interagency review and are making working drafts of them available to the public.", "theme": "Policy", "title": "Trump Presidency Could Threaten California ISO Plan for Western Power Market", "comments": "5", "tags": ["caiso", "editors news feed", "trump", "western power market"]}
{"body": " Norwegian state-owned oil company Statoil is the winning bidder for the right to build a wind farm across nearly 80,000 acres off the coast of New York. The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Managements auction was for an area approximately 12 miles off the west end of Long Island, which should be able to accommodate up to about 800 megawatts of wind power. A wind farm that size would rival some of the largest offshore wind farms in Europe. There were approximately a dozen bidders that were qualified to bid, but only six took part in the auction. The bidding went through 33 rounds before Statoil ultimately emerged victorious. Statoils bid of $42.5 million is hardly the final price tag, as the Norwegian company still needs to go through various environmental and feasibility studies, as well as to find an offtaker for the power it will eventually produce. The other bidder in the final rounds was the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. NYSERDA hoped to lower the cost by winning the acreage and then bundling that with an offtake agreement. But Statoils win suggests that an individual developer thinks it can do it for cheaper than buying the bundled package from the government. NYSERDAs approach was similar to how many offshore wind auctions work in Europe. No matter the approach, the project will certainly be more expensive than similar ones in Europe, which has about 11 gigawatts of offshore wind. NYSERDA will also still be heavily involved, providing assistance with studies and permitting. Just last week, NYSERDA put out an RFP for expert consultants as the state finalizes its offshore wind master plan. We are excited to have submitted the most competitive bid in a highly attractive project, Statoils first offshore wind lease in the U.S., Irene Rummelhoff, Statoils executive vice president for New Energy Solutions, said in a statement. We now look forward to working with New Yorks state agencies and contributing to New York meeting its future energy needs by applying our offshore experience and engineering expertise. That expertise draws on Statoils growing interest in offshore wind and long history in offshore oil and gas. It is a joint developer for a handful of wind farms off of the coast of the U.K., and is developing a floating offshore wind farm that will also be paired with energy storage. One of the U.K. projects is Dogger Bank Wind Farm, which is more than 100 miles offshore of Yorkshire and is expected to have a target installed capacity of at least 7 gigawatts of wind power, and potentially up to 13 gigawatts. Although NYSERDA will not lead the project, it will be critical for getting buy-in from local communities, especially the fishing community. NYSERDA will continue to work closely with coastal community members, the fishing and maritime industries and advocates to identify additional offshore wind energy sites to be included in New Yorks Offshore Wind Master Plan,\" the agency said in a statement. Enthusiasm and acceptance for the project is critical not only for Statoil and New York state, but also for the larger offshore wind industry in the U.S. Europe has gigawatts of offshore wind and some of those projects are now coming in at well under $100 per megawatt-hour. By comparison, the U.S. has only a single offshore wind farm off of Rhode Island, which is delivering 30 megawatts of power to Block Island. New York, Massachusetts and other states, however, are getting more serious about offshore wind. Massachusetts has a goal of 1.6 gigawatts of offshore wind in the next decade and New York has a goal of getting half of its electricity from clean generation sources by 2030. To get there, the U.S. offshore wind industry will have to scale up quickly from virtually nothing. It will require larger projects and more support from state governments for permitting. But with lessons learned from Europe, many in the industry feel the time is finally right for offshore wind to become a viable market in the U.S. Over the past decade, there has been consistent progress toward the realization of offshore wind powers potential in America, Nancy Sopko, the manager for advocacy and federal legislative affairs at the American Wind Energy Association, said in a statement. She added that the construction of the New York project alone could produce thousands of jobs. Statoil said the project will be a phased development, with the first phase delivering 400 to 600 megawatts.", "theme": "Wind Projects", "title": "Statoil Wins NY Offshore Wind Rights for $42M", "comments": "6", "tags": ["new york", "nyserda", "offshore wind", "statoil", "wind"]}
{"body": " Utility-scale solar photovoltaic power added more than 9 gigawatts (AC) of capacity to the U.S. power grid in 2016, making it the most dominant new fuel source for the first time in a calendar year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Natural gas was not far behind at 8 gigawatts of new capacity and wind added nearly 7 gigawatts, according to the EIA. Wind, solar and natural gas made up 93 percent of new capacity, with some hydropower and nuclear rounding out the fuel mix of new additions.  When distributed solar is included in the tally, solars role in new U.S. capacity is even stronger. GTM Research forecasts about 2.5 gigawatts (DC) of distributed residential solar PV projects in 2016, and an estimated total for the year of 14 gigawatts (DC) -- or 11.2 gigawatts (AC) to use EIA terms -- when utility, commercial and residential solar projects are tallied. EIA acknowledges that its annual total could be a little low given that it's only based on reported additions and not projections. There arediscrepancies that might not put solar ahead of natural gas in the end.This year, as is the case in many years, expected capacity additions in December are much higher than in any other month, EIA states. In past years, the rush of December additions has been because of the looming expiration of tax credits at the end of the year. With the extension of the federal solar Investment Tax Credit at the end of 2015, however, there could be fewer clean energy projects rushing to come on-line by years end. In fact, there is already quite a bit of spillover of solar projects from 2016 into 2017. There is also a matter of reporting. GTM Research tracks additions in DC, while EIA uses AC. GTMR forecasts 10.2 gigawatts (DC) of utility-scale solar capacity will be added in 2016. When converted from DC to AC, that figure is just under 8 gigawatts (AC), which is lower than EIA's 9.5 gigawatt (AC) number. While the final figures are up for debate in the last days of December, the surge of solar in 2016 is undeniable. Solars dominance as a source of new energy is not limited to California, although it does make up the majority of additions. North Carolina installed more than a gigawatt of utility-scale solar, with Nevada, Texas and Georgia ranking in the top five. The amount of utility-scale solar installed in 2016 in the U.S. is more than the past three years combined, according to EIA.    Wind additions were slightly lower than last year, although the U.S. did see its first offshore wind farm come on-line.

{"body": " The Atlantic: Can Trump Reverse Obama's Arctic-Drilling Ban? In the autumn of 1948, President Harry Truman made an important declaration about who controlled the huge seams of oil and gas hidden beneath the seafloor around the coast of the United States. The federal government -- aware of the long-range worldwide need for new sources of petroleum and other minerals -- would try to encourage the development of those resources, he said. Congress ratified Trumans proclamation. Five years later, in 1953, it sought to clarify its terms and restore some rights to the states. It adopted the Continental Outer Shelf Lands Act. Now, there is a new long-range worldwide need -- and it is not for new sources of petroleum. If the world hopes to stave off catastrophic climate change, it must begin to roll back its usage of fossil fuels like petroleum. It must leave huge seams of oil and natural gas in the ground, permanently untapped. President Obama has acted on this new reality, and now there is going to be a big fight about that 1953 law.

The India Clean Energy Finance Initiative will support small projects with seed capital and assistance to help them grow as they then look to OPIC to work with.\" Another scheme, the U.S.-Africa Clean Energy Finance Initiative (ACEF), has already deployed $20 million in grants and is on track to catalyze over $1 billion in project investment in Africa from a combination of private capital providers and OPIC. PV Magazine: India to Reach 57 Percent Renewable Penetration by 2027, Forecasts Government The Indian government is expecting the country to source 57 percent of its energy requirements from renewables by 2027  three years and many percentage points ahead of the 2030 target of 40 percent agreed to in Paris at COP21 last year. According to the plan, India will have installed 275 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2027 -- with more than half of that figure likely to come from solar. Piyush Goyal, the Indian energy minister, has also confirmed that there will be no new coal-fired power plants built until at least 2027 as the country hedges its energy future on renewable energy and takes seriously its pledges made under the Paris Agreement. Around $20 billion has been committed to Indias soaring solar sector by Taiwans Foxconn and Japans Softbank, with domestic assistance arriving in the form of Indias Bharti Enterprises. Indian developers are also jostling for greater prominence, with Tata pledging to draw 40 percent of its energy from renewable source by 2025, and Adani and Azure Power stepping up their solar investments. Des Moines Register: Iowa's New Energy Plan -- More Renewable Energy, Stronger Power Grid The state released a broad report Wednesday looking at Iowa's energy needs over the next decade, with 45 recommendations that range from modernizing the state's electric power grid to improving state tax credits for solar energy.

{"body": " Back in January, I suggested 2016 was the year for wholesale power market reform.So, was it? While shifts in these kinds of institutions take longer than one year, weve seen real progress on the four factors that made 2016 a turning point, and we believe progress will continue in 2017. Americas electricity mix continues to churn. A trend of less-energy-intensive economic growth is combining with policy support for wind and solar to produce an oversupply situation. Markets are adjusting by pushing out more expensive nuclear and coal plants, and in 2016 some regulators gave in to the temptation of supporting old facilities in wholesale markets. Take FirstEnergys bid to re-regulate in the face of stiff wholesale market competition for its coal and nuclear facilities, for example. But the whole idea of competitive markets, promoted by the likes of FirstEnergy themselves, was to shift risk onto independent power producers and allow them to earn upside -- or face downside. During this period of transition, policymakers must pay particularly close attention to proposed wholesale power market changes. Most proposals will invoke reliability, but forward-looking market improvements for reliability will expose the value of grid services were likely to need in the future while finding ways to pay whichever resources are capable of providing them. These market improvements may cause some old plants to retire, but they will also create new revenue streams for existing units -- and cost-effective new resources capable of providing valuable grid services. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC, the agency that governs Americas wholesale markets) and some of the forward-thinking regional markets are making moves to build new ways to support system reliability and flexibility during this transition period. But plenty more can be done to build markets optimizing a clean portfolio of energy resources at least cost. Despite three of five FERC seats being open in 2017, we remain optimistic the new commissioners will stay true to the FERC charter and uphold the free market principles that make these markets work. 2016s four factors are still quite relevant, and will continue driving change in 2017: The ability to balance supply and demand will grow in importance as variable renewables become a larger share of the electricity mix. Time-shifting resources like demand response and storage can help tremendously as the power system syncs with the rhythm of natural weather systems. FERC took two big steps in 2016 to co-optimize supply and demand. First, the commission issued a rule requiring wholesale markets to settle every 5 minutes. This bolsters flexibility since dispatching and paying market participants on shorter intervals values flexible resources able to quickly respond to price signals. Second, FERC proposed a new rule last month to knock down barriers preventing distributed resource participation in wholesale markets. This proposed rule highlights the need to update outdated market design details prohibiting certain resources like energy storage and demand response from participating in markets and getting paid for the valuable services they can provide. Still, more work remains to be done. For example, dispatchable demand response is not yet fully integrated into real-time grid operations anywhere in the country. In 2014, Texas market operators began enumerating the challenges to overcome to get demand-response into traditional real-time dispatch algorithms. Since then, California and New York market operators have taken initial steps toward building demand response into real-time operations. Hopefully, given todays big data capabilities and the growth of businesses able to provide reliable, dispatchable demand response, market operators can solve this challenge in 2017. Many parts of the U.S. are oversupplied with capacity right now, putting downward pressure on wholesale market prices. As a result, well-functioning markets will edge certain uneconomic plants out of the system. Wholesale market operators may be tempted to change market products or market designs to ensure sufficient revenue flows to those old plants, but this is a Sisyphean battle. Rather than adjusting market rules to prop up costly facilities no longer serving the system, markets must begin to define and expose the value of specific services needed on the grid (fast start, fast ramping, etc.), allowing all resources to compete evenly and provide those services at least cost. This will pay for the system attributes needed in the future, creating a forward-looking market with solid potential for growth, rather than contorting existing markets to support unneeded and uneconomic plants. Existing plants able to provide valuable services will survive, provided they are cost competitive with new technology options. Innovative market products are enabling market operators to value the capabilities needed as the energy mix evolves. For example, PJMs Regulation D product (originally created in 2012) creates a separate frequency regulation product for resources that can respond very quickly but may not be able to sustain energy output over long periods. Other RTOs are now considering adopting similar products. And Californias Flexible Ramping Product, implemented just last month, exemplifies another approach: This new product is designed to improve reliability while ensuring resources capable of ramping quickly get paid for that valuable service. Of course, as markets adjust to oversupply by leaving behind some generators, policymakers must consider reliability and transition assistance for workers and communities affected by plant closures. Luckily, evidence is growing that markets will be quite capable of maintaining reliability as old units shut down and are replaced by portfolios of cleaner resources. A recent Brattle analysis shows upcoming coal retirements are unlikely to affect reliability in Texas (even though the state has one of the lowest reserve margins in the nation), because of other resources under construction, planned, or possible in the near-term. And, providing future-oriented job training programs or pensions for displaced workers is a less expensive way to support affected workers and communities than continuing to use ratepayer funds to prop up overall operations of uneconomic plants. Given FERCs newest proposed rule to better integrate storage and aggregated distributed resources, the question about the interface between the utility and the market operator is more critical than ever. Some utilities are making progress defining their role and business model given all the changes we are witnessing, but more specific and clear proposals are badly needed. New York and California are have begun running up against some of these questions. In New York, the Public Service Commission began a process to turn utilities into market platform providers for distributed energy resources. Since New York prohibits utilities from owning these resources, the commission plans to optimize the system via market-based pricing that will interact with wholesale market prices. We can expect more of the details of those interactions between distribution and bulk transmission level prices to be worked out in 2017. California utilities are also piloting distributed energy resource auctions to compete with centralized generation in providing local capacity, but exactly how the resulting revenue streams couple with wholesale market bidding remains to be seen. Signs point to 2017 being the year for more concrete proposals on how to divide responsibility and activities related to integrating and pricing resources across the transmission-distribution interface. Progress in wholesale markets can seem slow, but momentum is building for changes enabling more resources to participate in the markets and trade more flexibility. One change already helping reward flexible resources is Texas operating reserve demand curve, which increases real-time market prices in advance of triggering an official scarcity event. This has proven to be effective, and the mechanism is now spreading across the nation, especially as regional market operators look to implement FERCs 5-minute settlement rule. Out west, the Energy Imbalance Market now enables six of the regions largest utilities to trade certain balancing services, increasing the flexibility of the regions grid. Market benefits have topped $110 million just two years after the program first launched, and several more utilities have stated their intention to join. If FERCs proposed rule for storage and aggregated distributed resources is finalized early next year as expected, implementation will move to the regional markets. Each will then propose their own specific changes to their products and operations to enable more resources to participate and get paid in the market.  These steps will each advance the conversation about balancing supply and demand, valuing flexibility, and enabling a more diverse set of resources to participate in the market. 2016 saw many positive steps forward, but far more progress is needed in 2017 (and beyond) to future-proof Americas power markets. *** Sonia Aggarwal directs Americas Power Plan.

{"body": " A U.K. startup called Electron is proposing a blockchain-based electricity and gas meter registration system to help consumers switch between utilities more easily. Blockchain technology enables reliable coordination between multiple parties without the need for a central coordinating entity, said Electron in a press release. The company sees this platform as a first step in harnessing blockchain technology to transform the virtual infrastructure of the energy industry. Registering meter details on a blockchain could help U.K. utilities comply with upcoming regulation that is expected to allow consumers to change from one energy provider to another in a single day, said Electron chief operating officer Joanna Hubbard. Currently, because there is no central register of all electricity and gas meters, it can take between 17 and 20 days to change utilities in the U.K. A blockchain could cut this time to mere minutes, Electron believes. The U.K. energy regulator, Ofgem, launched the next-day switching proposal in February 2015. The consultation period for the proposal has now closed and utilities are awaiting a final decision. We propose to lead a program of work to deliver these policy proposals for consumers by 2019, Ofgem says on its website. Ofgem believes the measure can be achieved by replacing the existing network-run gas and electricity switching services with a new centralized switching service. If created in a traditional manner, though, the switching service would need to build and maintain a massive database of meter information, which Hubbard says would be costly and unwieldy. Using a blockchain would be millions cheaper, she said. With the advent of blockchain technology, a central database sounds very inefficient now, she commented. Furthermore, she said, the blockchain approach would make it easier to integrate the meter data into applications such as demand response or peer-to-peer energy trading. This is where the real interest lies as far as Electron is concerned. The company intends to offer the meter registration blockchain as a free platform to utilities, and then create value-added services around it. Were not looking to commercialize this, Hubbard said. Were looking to deliver it to the industry; then we are well placed to build on it. For now, however, Electron still has a long way to go before making this plan a reality. The company has shown its concept could work in theory, by creating an Ethereum blockchain and filling it with simulated data from 53 million metering points and 60 energy suppliers. However, the company needs to get the U.K. electricity sector on board, starting with utilities, and wed have to get buy-in from Ofgem, said Hubbard. She said Electron was already in talks with potential utility partners and the reception has been very warm, although none had yet signed up for the concept. Smaller energy providers were interested because faster switching might allow them to pick up new customers more quickly, she noted. For larger energy companies, the interest was more around the development of blockchain-based applications such as demand response. With the right partnerships in place, Hubbard said Electron, which is backed by 500,000 ($617,000) from private investors and 150,000 ($185,000) from two Innovate U.K. grants, could roll out the blockchain registry within 18 to 24 months. Electrons proposal comes amid growing interest in the use of blockchains across the energy sector. Siemens recently announced it would be collaborating with a U.S. company called LO3 Energy on a peer-to-peer energy trading blockchain project in New York. And in a February 2016 forum moderated by GTM CEO Scott Clavenna, Joi Ito, the director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's media lab, declared: \"It would be a waste to use the blockchain to just do meter billing.\" Hubbard acknowledges that blockchains potential goes far beyond meter data, but said someone needs to provide the infrastructure to aggregate metering information in the first place. Were the only people doing this top-down approach, she said. The idea is that other blockchains (for example for tokens or peer-to-peer trading) will be interoperable with Electrons platform, and that all told this could have a transformational effect. For now, in the U.K, This industry still takes 14 months to settle financial transactions, said Hubbard.

{"body": " 8minutenergy Renewables claims to have \"the first operational solar PV installation to beat fossil fuel prices in California.\" The recently commissioned 155-megawatt (AC) Springbok 2 Solar Farm in Kern County will provide electricity to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power at $35 to $38 per megawatt-hour (adjusted for inflation) over the PPA term. Is that the lowest-cost PPA ever? The math is a little fuzzy, and 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour might not be the lowest PPA price ever, but it's in the ballpark, and a real sign of things to come. According to GTM Research solar analyst Colin Smith, when GTM calculates PPA prices, it doesn't adjust for inflation, which is what 8minutenergy is doing here. 8minutenergy used the \"average U.S. inflation rate over the past 40 years to calculate the equivalent first year price (with inflation as escalator) to Springbok 2s PPA price and levelized cost of energy (using LADWPs weighted average cost of capital).\" Smith notes, \"That being said, when we compare this to others, it is one of the lowest PPA prices for operating projects -- but not the lowest. For instance, NextEra brought its Chaves County project on-line in October, which we calculated to have an average PPA price of $42.08 per megawatt-hour, with a $36.44 year-one price and a 2 percent escalator.\" \"We are continuing to see declining prices and have seen sub-$40 per megawatt-hour PPAs before and are going to see more soon,\" he added. \"I wouldn't be shocked to see year-one pricing below $30 per megawatt-hour soon, too. In short, we are going to see PPA prices continue to decline along with declining all-in utility PV costs, driven primarily by declining balance-of-system and module prices.\" The biggest risk is the possible rise in interest rates, according to Smith. Financial analysts at Lazard recently released the latest version of their levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) analysis. These are unsubsidized prices.  Source: Lazard Shayle Kann, the senior VP of GTM Research, in a keynote address at the recent Solar Market Insight Conference in San Diego said, \"This is going to be a banner year for solar capacity being added to the grid in the U.S. When all is said and done, solar may well be the top -- if not one of the top two or three -- sources of new electricity generating capacity and, potentially, new generation in the U.S.\" \"You could see a standard, best-in-class, turnkey, utility-scale project under a $1.00 per watt, this benchmark we've been talking about for almost a decade now, by 2018 -- well before the 2020 SunShot goal,\" he added.  \"2016 is the first year in which the average PPA price for a new utility-scale project in the U.S. is below 5 cents per kilowatt-hour,\" Kann continued. \"You're probably going to start to see, over the next couple of years, what feel like ridiculously low PPA prices,\" he said. \"You're starting to see this in some international markets. We've seen sub-3 cents per kilowatt-hour PPAs signed in places like Chile, Mexico and the Middle East. You'll start to see that coming in the U.S. as well.\" In an earlier interview Jim Hughes, former CEO of First Solar, said, \"I fully believe that within 10 years we'll be talking about low-3-cent power on a peak basis.\" It looks like Hughes' prediction is going to happen even sooner than he expected.

{"body": " I got lucky with my predictions for rooftop solar in 2016 -- pretty much on target with nine out of the 10 darts that I threw. But this year is shaping up to be much more challenging, with routine solar-coaster turmoil combined with political uncertainty. Looking forward to 2017, my list no longer includes the benefits of the Clean Power Plan and 500 million solar panels (along with the EPA and half the equity in the remaining solar module companies). Nevertheless, I remain very optimistic about the future of clean technology industries simply because their economic benefits have been proven. So here are my 10 predictions for rooftop solar in 2017. 1. Module prices will stay at current low levels, roughly 35 cents for megawatt orders, roughly 45 cents for container quantities and roughly 55 cents for small orders. Manufacturers prefer to operate their production lines at full capacity (and full employment), even if they are selling at breakeven or less. As the year progresses, these low prices will apply to higher and higher efficiency modules. Differentiated modules -- those with integrated electronics, simplified installation technology or 20+ percent efficiency -- will command higher price points and margins simply because they provide more value to installers and homeowners. 2. U.S. solar manufacturing will continue to decline. Sadly, the module supply chain is almost entirely from Asia: wafers, cells, backsheets, EVA, junction boxes, glass and aluminum frames are all cheaper in China with comparable quality. Political rhetoric will not bring manufacturing back without a good plan to address the supply of key components in the U.S. Ironically, tariffs have made things much worse for U.S. manufacturers -- removing tariffs on cells and extruded aluminum for solar would go a long way toward improving the economics for the remaining U.S. module manufacturers. 3. Community solar will struggle to get traction. Customers want both clean and cheap solar power. But when community solar is developed by utilities, they charge a premium for solar, so customers dont buy. When lower per kilowatt-hour cost community solar projects are developed independently, utilities act to delay projects or increase costs in order to protect their monopoly. More local governments will step in with community-choice Aggregation programs. These CCA programs break the utility electricity sales monopoly, providing clean and cheap power to customers. 4. State solar organizations will gain membership and influence throughout the U.S. as net energy metering and rate design issues are tackled by state public utility commissions. Meanwhile, the Solar Energy Industries Association will fight a rear-guard action in Washington, D.C. to preserve the most precious TLAs (three-letter acronyms): ITC, DOE and EPA. 5. The TLA for 2017 is \"BTM.\" The divide between utility-scale solar and behind-the-meter (BTM) solar will become more apparent as the zero-sum game for selling electricity intensifies. The cost difference between utility PPAs (about $0.04 per kilowatt-hour) and customer-owned residential solar (about $0.06 per kilowatt-hour) will continue to narrow, eliminating the argument that bigger is better when it comes to solar deployments. 6. Small local and medium-sized regional rooftop solar companies will continue to thrive. Bigger is badder in the solar business. Companies that use debt to claw to the top of the revenue hill are inevitably knocked off and out. Stubbornly high customer-acquisition costs will make it cost-prohibitive for any installation company to pursue a fast growth strategy without outside investors. More simplified solar financing options will become available to small and medium-sized installers -- and companies providing these independent financing products will thrive. Meanwhile, high-pressure sales installers/deal originators who were hooked on no-money-down financing and naive customers will discover they have no referral business and cannot continue to pay high customer-acquisition costs.  7. Utility deployments of battery storage system will grow rapidly in the U.S. Trial programs will drive this initial demand, and income from rate-basing these installations will improve the bottom lines of utilities and vendors. Meanwhile, customers will see zero impact other than higher rates. BTM energy storage systems will continue to be deployed gradually in Hawaii and to a lesser degree in California. Residential BTM deployments need better economic drivers (lower equipment costs, incentives and even demand charges) before deployments begin to take off. BTM energy storage systems are still at the stage that rooftop solar was in 2000. 8. Customers will not install technology that provides services to utilities -- even if products are free with a small return value stream -- because utilities will not make the value stream significant enough. Customers learned their lessons with smart meters: cool technology that benefits utilities tends to raise rates, provides negligible access to customer data, and enables customer-unfriendly services (demand charges and dynamic TOU rates). As we saw with rooftop solar and smart thermostats, customers would rather invest in energy-saving technology themselves and follow price signals to reap the benefits. On the other hand, utilities prefer to build this infrastructure and rate-base these investments -- thereby guaranteeing a profit. Utilities and PUCs like the intellectual concept of distributed energy resources, but the value to customers is too low and intangible, especially when customers can invest in similar technology themselves. 9. Storage equipment companies will continue to underestimate the true cost of their new products in order to generate buzz and initial sales. These true costs include diverse component integration, software configuration, permitting, installation, troubleshooting and service. Companies that provide a fully integrated solution, including all required hardware and software in a single plug-and-play box, will get the most initial traction from experienced installers. 10. President Trump will embrace solar because it is cheaper and continues to be a jobs engine.

{"body": " European electric-vehicle adoption wont take off until at least 2025, according to research by GTMs parent company Wood Mackenzie. The high cost of new cars, coupled with limited battery life and vehicle range, is hampering the take-up of EVs compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, says Wood Mackenzie in a study titled Is the European EV Market on the Verge of a Breakthrough? Today, EVs account for less than one in every 500 cars on European roads, and mainstream adoption is not likely to happen until battery costs drop from their current level of $200 to $400 per kilowatt-hour, down to around $100 per kilowatt-hour. 'Mainstream' would be defined as the moment when EVs are able to exhibit sufficient range and reliability at an affordable price to compete effectively with conventional ICE cars, said study author Iain Mowat, Wood Mackenzie senior research analyst for refining and oil product markets. While EVs could start to do this sooner in the executive and upper-medium car segments, it's really when EVs start to dominate new car sales in the lower-medium and small-car markets that these low-emissions vehicles could be regarded as reaching mainstream status, he said. It will be more challenging for carmakers to produce competitively priced EVs in the small and lower-medium segments, he said. This is where ICE cars are least expensive and have the best fuel economy. EV pricing means adoption across Europe is, for now, heavily dependent on government subsidies. Not coincidentally, the only European country where Wood Mackenzie believes EVs are nearing mainstream adoption is Norway, which also has the most generous support schemes. The government has restructured the fiscal framework for passenger cars to ensure EVs are now cheaper than conventional ICE cars, said Mowat. EV penetration is now higher in Norway than any other country in the world. This approach would be harder in a country with a manufacturing base of ICE cars, he stated. With no indigenous ICE manufacturing, and a fully renewable power grid, Norway is a trailblazer for EV adoption. Wood Mackenzie believes most other European countries cannot afford to match these subsidy levels. There are limited EV subsidies in place across France, Germany and the U.K., but if these were stripped out, then battery costs would leave all-electric vehicles at the high end of the car market, discouraging wider take-up, Wood Mackenzie said. Another factor that other studies may have overlooked is how the price of electricity might affect the economics of EV ownership. In Germany, for example, the high cost of grid power -- which is, ironically, partly a result of government actions to support the move to a carbon-free economy -- means it is more expensive to run an EV than it is to drive a diesel car, Mowat said. The study cites a number of other potential roadblocks for EV adoption, the impact of which is more difficult to ascertain at present. One is EV charging station availability. Mowat said uncertainty over regulation and business models for charging infrastructure could act as a drag on charger deployment. But availability is ramping up quite quickly and will be perceived as less of a barrier for consumers once range starts to improve to around 300 kilometers per charge, he said. Another potential challenge is how battery cost reductions might be affected by raw materials prices, particularly for lithium, cobalt and nickel. Mowat agreed with other industry observers that lithium availability, at least, is not likely to be a big problem for the battery industry. The lithium supply chain is already responding to increasing demand for the material, he noted. But materials such as cobalt and nickel are more significant cost components in a lithium-ion battery, so the global supply and price of these commodities could become a major factor in terms of how the EV market evolves. A final factor in the EV cost-reduction path is whether or not car manufacturers are able to offset the upfront cost of batteries by reusing them in second-life stationary storage applications. Mowat confirmed EV makers would probably attempt to do this. There will likely be a secondary market for batteries, he said. Indeed, that market is already under development.

{"body": " Deadlines keep the world on track. They are the metric by which we manage our time, determine priorities and assess progress -- though some people are better at meeting them than others. Among the many rules governing the electricity grid, there are innumerable timelines, deadlines and enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure the grid keeps humming along, providing safe and reliable electricity to the masses. Yet the surge of requests to connect new distributed energy resources to the grid and the resulting queue backlogs have revealed that states may be falling short when it comes to enforcing relevant timelines and deadlines for interconnection. In the previous article in this series, we discussed the important role of clear and explicit interconnection timelines for expeditiously processing the increasing volume of applicants seeking to connect to the grid. But what good are timelines if theyre not followed? And how do you make sure that everyone -- both applicants and utilities -- does what theyre supposed to do on time? The key is having clear rules for enforcement that avoid confusion and keep the interconnection queue moving. Timeline enforcement is especially important when connecting to the grid because everyone in the interconnection queue relies on the timeliness of everyone in front of them. If the utility is trying to look at the impact to the grid from one project, it needs to know the impacts of all the projects interconnecting ahead of it. So, when one applicant gets behind in meeting its deadlines -- or the utility isnt keeping up with processing applications -- everything slows down and everyone suffers. While many states specify timelines in their interconnection rules, few have specific provisions to address what happens when deadlines are missed or delayed. Clogged interconnection queues are becoming increasingly common as more clean energy projects seek to connect to the grid. For example, North Carolina has seen major queue backlogs for the past few years and continues to struggle with them, despite recently having taken some steps to clear its queue. The timeline enforcement rules that do exist are typically focused on the applicants side, kicking an applicant out of the queue if it isnt sticking with the timelines. While this seems straightforward, in practice, utilities have sometimes been hesitant to take the step because they worry about resulting complaints and disputes. Therefore, in addition to incorporating well-defined deadlines and extensions into their interconnection procedures when warranted, its important for states to make their queue-removal provisions clear and transparent. The onus to keep the queue moving, however, does not fall solely on the applicants. Utilities also need to meet specified deadlines for completing studies and processing applications. A lagging queue has a big impact on applicants. They have set expectations with their customers and financiers, who in turn are holding applicants accountable for meeting those expectations. In some cases, missing deadlines can cause applicants to incur additional costs, impacting the applicants financing and bottom line. Unfortunately, usually the only recourse for applicants when the utility is falling behind is to follow dispute resolution procedures, which typically culminate in filing a formal complaint. Frequently, an applicant doesnt want to take the route of filing a formal complaint against the same utility that it needs to work with to get its project approved. Most will only take this step if its absolutely necessary. So, how can states ensure that utilities adhere to deadlines? They can adopt rules requiring utilities to regularly report on their timeline compliance. Then, if the reporting shows the utility isnt meeting its deadlines, the state can consider whether and how to penalize or incentivize the utility appropriately. This keeps enforcement uniform for all, instead of leaving monitoring of the utilities up to whichever applicants feel compelled to pursue dispute resolution. Reliable, unbiased enforcement of utilities deadlines is critical because they are the key gatekeepers of the electricity grid and thus the energy market. In addition, this approach remedies the imbalance between entities with and without a direct financial stake in the interconnection process. Applicants that fail to meet their deadlines risk getting kicked out of the queue, while utilities risk a commission-imposed penalty. Should formal complaints be deemed necessary, the option remains on the table but becomes more of a last resort, rather than the go-to enforcement mechanism. Does this sort of regulatory structure work? It appears to. Massachusetts adopted a timeline enforcement mechanism similar to whats described above, providing for more reporting requirements for utilities and subjecting them to penalties for failing to comply with timelines. Since implementation of the timeline enforcement mechanism, along with other interconnection process improvements, Massachusetts utilities have reported that they are meeting interconnection timelines with flying colors. If other states adopt such an enforcement mechanism, we will be able to see whether it has its intended effect elsewhere, as well. Neighboring New York is actively considering similar measures but is taking a somewhat different approach. Following a tremendous backlog in its queue as more and more distributed generation facilities attempt to come on-line, New York is currently evaluating rules that would incentivize timeline compliance as part of its broader Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) effort. A proposed interconnection earning adjustment mechanism (EAM) under development would allow New York utilities to earn more if they meet certain interconnection goals, including targets related to timeline compliance and customer satisfaction. The interconnection EAM is one of several EAMs being considered, and together they represent New Yorks first step toward a more outcome-oriented ratemaking paradigm. While time will tell, a carrot-and-stick combination of EAMs and other timeline enforcement provisions could be just the ticket for keeping queue backlog at bay. But beyond these basic tools to incentivize timeline compliance, interconnection is further improved by increased data transparency and information sharing. For example, better access to grid data, through pre-application reports and distribution system maps, can help applicants identify good grid locations for projects and further streamline the process for everyone. And better tracking and reporting of data regarding the interconnection process itself can help regulators, utilities and other stakeholders identify bottlenecks and address them before they bog everything down. Stay tuned for our next article in the series to learn what tools utilities and regulators are using to accomplish these important goals.

{"body": " The power sector is similar to geology in the sense that change must often be measured over long periods of time in order to see significant patterns. Increasingly, however, the timescale of change in the power sector is accelerating. As we look back at 2016, we see an industry grappling with seismic upheaval, and trying to adapt faster than it ever has before. Here are five trends that pushed the utility industry in 2016. Resource planning moves to the grid edge. Across the board, integrated resource planning has gone on to include distributed energy resources, said Matt Mooren, an energy and utilities expert at PA Consulting Group. And not just traditional resources like energy efficiency and demand response, but in many areas, such as solar, storage and electric vehicles and their impact on electric sales and demand. While California and New York are the prime examples of regulatory and market changes that are pushing utilities to consider resources at the grid edge, it is also increasingly happening in the independent system operators (ISOs) and in other states, particularly in the West, said Mooren. This was not the first year that including DERs in integrated resource planning emerged as a talking point, but rather, it was the year where utilities, beyond a few early movers, began seriously considering what they need to get there. The realization of the need for granular information and looking beyond coincident peak demand is happening now, said Zach Pollock, an energy and utilities expert atPA Consulting. Of course, it will take years to put in place the technical capability for the sort of location-specific data that will be required to truly integrate DERs into distribution system forecasting and capital investment planning on a wide scale. But 2016 is the year that many utilities began articulating what that approach could look like and examining the investments they need to make resource planning at the grid edge a reality. Beyond NEM. It seems like a lifetime ago, but it was just in January that Californias Public Utilities Commission voted on its net energy metering successor tariff. Just before the year began, Nevadas regulators voted unanimously to institute a new solar rate that did not grandfather in existing customers. After months of battles, the regulators restored net metering for existing customers, and some new ones. For many states, however, the conversation is moving beyond retail-rate net metering to designing rates that offer a more complete valuation of not just solar, but also other distributed resources, like storage. More broadly, well see shifts toward new customer classes and distribution system locational pricing considerations, said Mooren, although there is still a lot of work that needs to be done on the technical side before these rates can be put in place. Regulation innovation. The regulation and oversight of electric utilities and independent power producers continued to evolve in 2016, and not just in terms of how utilities treat renewables and resources at the grid edge. In New York, regulators passed new rules on energy retailers, requiring them to offer better prices than the incumbent utility. In both New York and Illinois, the states set zero emission credits to keep nuclear plants open, a trend that could expand further in 2017, said Mooren, as certain states look to diversify their low-carbon energy mix through targeted subsidies. ISO expansion. The past year brought a renewed focus on the expansion of Californias grid operator. California already has an energy imbalance market (EIM), which was recently expanded to include PacifiCorp and NV Energy, and more utilities outside of California are slated to join. Beyond the EIM, there was a focus on wider regionalization this year in the West. Some fear it could bolster coal plants, but Mooren said it could also create a richer environment for the growth of corporate procurement of renewables by expanding the market into more solar and wind-rich regions. AMI, take two. Tens of millions of digital advanced meters were installed with the help of federal stimulus funds during the recession. After that, however, there was a lull in the smart meter market. The sluggish North American smart meter market picked up the pace in 2016, starting with Consolidated Edisons plan for about 5 million meters. This year, smart meters surpassed older technology, including analog and AMR to become the most dominant type of electric meter in the U.S. As utilities big and small make the case for smart meters, it [becomes] a more collaborative roadmap between vendors and utilities, said Pollock. Utilities are looking to deliver real time data and operationalize the streams of data that the meters produce. Regulators are also getting savvier about meter deployments, notes Pollock, and these large capital investments are coming with more scrutiny than ever before. As with most utility trends, these issues will not fade away when the calendar page turns to 2017, and will likely only accelerate as utilities and regulators explore new ways of doing business.", "theme": "Utilities", "title": "5 Emerging Trends That Drove the Utility Industry in 2016", "comments": "0", "tags": ["ami", "grid edge", "integrated resource planning", "pa consulting", "smart meters", "utility trends", "zec"]}

It's a precarious position for one of solar's early success stories. Enphase was a well-managed, VC-funded startup that created a new market, grew exceedingly fast and made it through the IPO window.

{"body": " The conversation about Hawaii and clean technology often focuses on the state's push for 100 percent renewable electricity by 2045. Beyond wind, solarand novel energy storage projects, however, Hawaii is a national leader in energy efficiency, according to a new report by Hawaii State Energy Office. For the past five years, the nonprofit Energy Services Coalition has ranked Hawaii first in government energy performance contracting. The state spends nearly six times the national average in performance contracting per capita.  In the past 20 years, the states energy office has signed more than $440 million in performance contracts for a savings of more than $1.1 billion. Hawaii is home to the single largest performance contract in the U.S., a $158 million deal with the Hawaii Department of Transportation that covers nearly all of the states airports. It will cut energy use in 12 airports by nearly 50 percent. In 2016, the Hawaiian government made huge strides in Energy Star certification. The private sector has also substantially increased its number of Energy Star buildings in the past decade.  Hawaii voted in 2015 to upgrade its building code to the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2015, which is expected to save more than 1 million megawatt-hours of energy in the first decade. The state is also updating the rules for reporting on its energy-efficiency portfolio standard, which is no longer part of its renewable portfolio standard reporting. Overall, the state has a goal of reducing energy demand by 4,300 gigawatt-hours by 2030, or about 40 percent below 2007 levels. Hawaii is not limiting its leadership role to renewables and efficiency. The state is convening regular stakeholder meetings to develop a transportation energy roadmap in a move away from petroleum. The roadmap will build off of the 22 recommendations that came out of the 2015 Hawaii Clean Energy Initiatives Transportation Energy Analysis. As for its renewable goals, Hawaii continues to grow its solar and wind portfolio, with hydro, geothermal, biomass and biofuels rounding out the mix. In 2015, Hawaii was getting nearly a quarter of its electricity from renewables.", "theme": "Energy Efficiency", "title": "Hawaii Wants to Lead on Energy Efficiency, Not Just Renewables", "comments": "9", "tags": ["energy efficiency", "energy performance contracts", "energy star", "hawaii"]}
{"body": " Viridity Energy, the startup with well-connected founders that sought to break open the business of aggregating distributed energy resources into virtual power plants, has been acquired by a company that offers it a lot of opportunity to expand. But the sale price, at least at first blush, doesnt appear to be very good news for its investors. Geothermal and renewable energy company Ormat Technologies announced Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire substantially all of Viriditys business and assets in a cash transaction starting with an initial consideration of $35 million at closing. Thats less than the $40+ million in venture capital the Philadelphia-based startup has brought in since its 2008 founding. Viridity raised about$8 million in 2009 from initial investor AltEnergy, which also led an $8.5 million investment in the company last year. In 2011 it raised $14 million from Intel Capital and Braemar Energy Ventures, and in 2012 it raised $15 million from Japans Mitsui. Tuesdays announcement did note, however, that Viridity shareholders could see more money from the sale, in the form of additional contingent considerationpayable in two installments upon the achievement of certain performance milestones measured at the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2020. The announcement didnt disclose how much more money Viridity could hope to see from these future payouts, or details on the performance milestones it would have to meet to earn them. Ormat did say that it expects Viridity to generate a positive operating income this year. Viridity will continue operations and retain current management and staff, as well as maintain all customer relationships and agreements, under the acquisition, which is expected to close in early 2017. Over its eight years in business, Viridity has been involved in a variety of projects, tied together by the startups VPower software. The startup, co-founded by former PJM COO and current New York Public Service Commission Chair Audrey Zibelman, has specialized in software to put the energy flexibility of batteries, on-site generators and demand-side flexibility to use in capturing financial opportunities in customers utility bills or grid energy markets. Viriditys earliest work was focused on grant-funded microgrid projects at university campuses in Pennsylvania and California. In 2012 it launched a project with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA) to use 300 kilowatts of batteries to capture regenerative braking power from trains and sell it into PJMs frequency regulation market, and recently expanded the scope of that project to 8.5 megawatts with partner Constellation Energy. Its also been building up a significant portfolio of battery-based energy storage projects serving the PJM frequency regulation market. That portfolio stood at about 23 megawatts as of early 2016, according to CEO Mark Treece. It includes one of the countrys largest solar-storage projects, a 7.5-megawatt battery array linked to a 4.2-megawatt solar system installed and integrated by S&C Electric for the municipal utility in Minster, Ohio. More recently, Viridity has been growing a separate line of business as a provider of white-labeled software to energy retailers such as Constellation, ConEdison Solutions and Engie Resources. These channel partners have about 3,000 commercial and industrial sites that are using Viriditys software, representing about 850 megawatts of controllable load, according to Tuesday's announcement. Engies VRewards program uses Viriditys software to help its C&I customers facilitate curtailed energy usage and lower total energy costs, for example. ConEdison Solutions, which sold its retail business to Constellation last summer, has been working with Viridity since 2012, including on a Department of Energy-funded project to enable 24 commercial buildings in New York to respond to grid needs. This mix of software capability and business lines will now belong to Ormat. Founded in 1965, Ormat is a major geothermal energy developer, and also specializes in waste heat recovery -- a valuable source of distributed energy at industrial sites that could be targets of Viriditys software. It has developed more than 2,000 megawatts of projects for customers, and holds a 710-megawatt generating portfolio in the U.S., Caribbean, Central America and Kenya. Its acquisition of Viridity marks Ormats entry into the rapidly growing energy storage and distributed generation markets, company CEO Isaac Angel said in Tuesdays announcement. Ormat intends to use the Viridity platform to accelerate growth, expand its market presence, and further develop Viriditys demand response VPower software platform and energy storage services. Plenty of other companies are competing with Viridity in aggregating and managing distributed energy assets for grid needs, and linking partnerships with energy giants. A few noteworthy startups in the field include Enbala, which is working with GE Energy Ventures and Edison International; Blue Pillar, which is working with NRG Energy; and Tangent Energy, which has a joint venture with backup generator company Cummins. On the microgrid side of the equation, grid giants like General Electric, Siemens, Schneider Electric and ABB are deploying projects that tie on-site generation, load controls and grid services. Demand response providers such as EnerNOC and CPower are also important players in this space, with thousands of megawatts of commercial-industrial load under management. Meanwhile, utility-owned energy services companies are also getting into the game, as Southern Companys $431 million acquisition of Power Secure and Edison Internationals launch of its acquisition-built Edison Energy indicate.", "theme": "Microgrids", "title": "Viridity Energy Sold to Ormat for $35MPlus Possible Future Payoff", "comments": "1", "tags": ["acquisition", "altenergy", "blue pillar", "braemar", "constellation", "demand response", "engie", "intel capital", "mitsui", "ormat", "venture capital", "viridity energy", "virtual power plant"]}
{"body": " The secretive Chinese-backed electric vehicle company Faraday Future is running out of roadway. There were several news reports about the companys financial distress and unstable business operations in the weeks leading up to the highly anticipated launch of Faraday Futures production vehicle last night at CES 2017. If they don't find money after CESthey will be out of money by February, a former executive told The Verge. A former employee familiar with Faraday Futures finances told BuzzFeed that the company is more than 30 days overdue on more than $100 million worth of payments to vendors and suppliers. The electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer currently faces lawsuits from a supplier and a landlord. Its been a year since Faraday Future, or FF, emerged from stealth mode. At CES 2016, FF launched an electric supercar concept that was lambasted for being ridiculously out of touch with market wants and needs. The FFZero wasnt anything like the autonomous consumer car FF had been teasing on social media. The FFZERO wasnt even functional. Since the first launch, FF has seen a slew of employees leave the company. Top executives Joerg Sommer, vice president of product marketing and growth, and Marco Mattiacci, global chief brand and commercial officer, left the company just days before last nights big reveal. The launch event did not disappoint in its grandeur -- but it did little to ease concerns that the FF 91 is no more than a hype machine.  Company leaders announced some impressive stats. The FF 91 has a 130-kilowatt-hour battery with a 378-mile all-electric range, a 1,050-horsepower engine, and a 0-60 mph acceleration time of just 2.39 seconds. Executives showcased the FF 91s speed in a simulated drag race with a Bentley Bentayga, a Ferrari 488 GTB and a Tesla Model S. The audience watched each vehicle zip across the pavilion. No surprise, the FF 91 appeared to win. The FF 91 isnt only designed for speed -- its also equipped with a suite of self-driving technologies, including 10 cameras, 12 long- and short-distance radars and 12 ultrasonic sensors. The car can park on its own. The FF 91 can also interact with the driver using facial recognition technology to automatically adjust vehicle settings, and help the driver reach the outside world through on-board high-speed Wi-Fi. Nick Sampson, FFs senior vice president and de facto spokesperson, said interested customers can now sign up for one of the companys 300 Alliance Edition launch vehicles, set for release in 2018, by putting down a $5,000 refundable deposit. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to an environmental production fund, to be named at a gala in March. We have to flip the automotive industry back on its head, break it down and build it up the way it should have been in the first place, independent of fossil fuels, said Sampson. Nothing was said at the launch event about FFs financial standing, or even about the companys production plans. Executives didnt even disclose the FF 91s final price. However, at the end of the event, Sampson did address the companys critics. Despite all of the naysayers and skeptics, we will persist, he said. We will carry on to make the impossible, possible. During the nearly 90-minute CES presentation, company leaders painted a picture of how the FF 91 could alter the current driving experience. The crossover design has a full-length sunroof thats intended to enhance the passenger experience, as well as a similar look to the Mercedes 2015 self-driving concept car. The FF 91s powerful electric drivetrain also makes it fun to ride in and emissions-free. But its not just a vehicle; its a mobility ecosystem. The FF 91s connected and autonomous vehicle technologies make transportation personalized and convenient -- when the technology works. Creating an FFID account for each person in the car enables the vehicle to remember seating and entertainment preferences that can be transferred across the FF EcoSystem-- a concept that seems to lend itself well to car sharing. Considering that the vast majority of cars today sit idle 95 percent of the time and spew out harmful pollution while theyre in motion, the FF 91 EV seems to be moving the auto industry in the right direction -- although the lack of information on FFs rollout plan make it hard to see how the company will progress. FF packed a punch with its first production vehicle, FF 91, crammed with eye-popping specs compared to all electric and/or luxury vehicles on the market today, but the launch event left many questions unanswered (not completely unlike its competitor Teslas prior launch events) on matters of practicality such as price tag, production timelines, and targets, said Ravi Manghani, GTM Research energy storage analyst, who also tracks EVs. While the presenters very deliberately mentioned the company as a risk-taker thats not burdened with prior history, it will be almost impossible to disassociate from the recent negative coverage of its financial troubles, he added.  Its important to cut through the PR spin, but its also important to consider how FF fits into the larger EV and mobility story. Its difficult to launch a new automotive company, and an electric one in particular. Only Tesla has been able to pull that off in a meaningful way in recent years, and even Teslas fate is still far from certain. While FF lacks a charismatic cleantech hero like Elon Musk as CEO, the company is still fostering innovation. As Electreks Fred Lambert recently pointed out: Theres no doubt that they are over-hyping their products for a company at this stage of development, but they also have over 1,000 employees -- most of them engineers -- working on real electric-vehicle technologies, and thats not vaporware.  Faraday Future is in trouble, but that doesnt mean the staff and the concepts are bad. If FF does fail, it would be a black eye to the entire EV sector. FFs demise could spook investors and keep them away from EV technology for years, the way the bankruptcies of Fisker and A123 did in 2013. Furthermore, a bankrupt EV company gives ammunition to cleantech opponents, in the same way Solyndras bankruptcy has hurt the broader solar industry. As consumers watch the industry evolve and see more EVs hit the road, and the Trump administration assesses the state of regulation and advanced vehicle technology, high-profile setbacks will do lasting harm to the EV industry, which has shown such promise and is so critical to severing our oil dependence, said Robbie Diamond, president and CEO of Securing Americas Future Energy, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on reducing U.S. oil dependence. Just because FFs work has purpose (at least to some), that doesnt make the companys problems go away. FF leaders need to be careful not to over-promise and under-deliver, said Diamond. At the same time, if the company manages to build strong interest in its new product, it could help FF raise the money it needs to realize the vision. Things have always been a little weird at Faraday. The company was founded in 2014, but has never had an official CEO. It was also initially unclear who was backing the company, which turned out Jia Yueting, founder of Chinese tech giant LeEco. Ding Lei, a top executive at LeEco was reportedly serving as FFs global CEO,\" but recently left the company. LeEco, meanwhile, is developing an electric car of its own called LeSEE, and has a partnership with Aston Martin separate from Faraday. Putting aside negative response to the FFZero at CES 2016, FF appeared to be on a roll early on last year. The company was scooping up employees from Tesla, Apple, BMW and other top tech brands. In April, FF was ramping up its $1 billion manufacturing plant in Nevada, where the state legislature approved $215 million in tax incentives. Then things really started to go downhill. Last summer, Jia sent a letter to employees acknowledging that LeEco had overextended itself. In November, news broke that FF has stopped working on the Nevada factory. Despite facing economic woes, LeEco just broke ground on its own $3 billion Chinese EV manufacturing plant. There are doubts as to whether FF or LeEco will actually be able to bring a car to market. Jia, who attended last nights FF launch event, seems committed to keeping the dream alive. We share a dream to restore the blue sky, he said.

{"body": " A new year means new resolutions, but here at GTM, we don't care about what you do at the gym. The real goal-setters out there are the ones committing to enter the fast-changing world of energy storage. It takes confidence, determination and a willingness to keep showing up after the thrill of a new product launch has faded. We don't know who will be taking that leap in 2017, but the figures are in for 2016. Here is a pretty comprehensive list of the companies that launched their first U.S. energy storage product or created a new business to serve that market last year. If we missed anybody, let us know in the comments section. The national residential solar specialist took its first step into the storage world with BrightBox. The solar-plus-storage combo comes with no-money-down lease or cash deal options, and first hit the streets in Hawaii last spring. Sunrun expanded it to California Dec. 14, and promised more states to come. The key applications the company has touted are optimized solar self-consumption and emergency backup for when the grid goes down. As net energy metering programs start to fade and the compensation for rooftop solar generation declines, we can expect to see solar companies turning to storage to add more value and attract new customers, said Ravi Manghani, energy storage director at GTM Research. \"In a lot of these markets, the early adopters have already gone solar,\" he said. \"The next layer of customers likely to install solar are probably looking for other benefits, which can be served by storage.\" Benefits like intelligent load management, resilience during blackouts and the ability to produce solar energy without exporting, for instance. Most solar installers won't have the wherewithal to design a product in-house like a Sunrun or SolarCity can, but they can easily procure storage from manufacturers and install it themselves.  Who needs VC backing when you can wrangle some cash online? This stylish San Diego startup nabbed an impressive $350,000 through a Kickstarter campaign that wrapped up in March. The company is pitching storage as a true home appliance: The two options, a sleek wall panel or a standing unit that looks more like a futuristic lamp, simply plug into a wall socket and store energy for that circuit. The freestanding unit even comes with built-in Bluetooth speakers. CEO Eric Clifton told Tech Insider that his team designed these batteries to be easily installed by the customer, in contrast to the 200-pound Tesla Powerwall. Orison also cuts out the inverter and installation soft costs that come with other battery systems. As of December, the company was still working out some kinks ahead of UL compliance and the start of manufacturing, so it's too early to know how well the product will perform. That said, the move to treat storage systems less like heavy equipment and more like consumer electronics is a promising one. Aerospace heavyweight and Pentagon darling Lockheed Martin reorganized the energy-related businesses it had picked up along the way and unveiled Lockheed Martin Energy in March. One key pillar of that is energy storage. Unusually, Lockheed tackles the market with both lithium-ion and flow battery products. The company designed a wholly integrated battery system for the former, while the latter relies on technology acquired from the startup Sun Catalytix. Lockheed has touted this flow formula as a cheaper, safer challenge to the incumbent flow chemistries, namely vanadium redox. Commercializing a brand new battery chemistry takes time and money. As GTM's Eric Wesoff pointed out, that's something this company has in bulk: \"Lockheed Martin comes to the battle with more than 100,000 employees worldwide and a market cap of $69.1 billion, as well as the advantage of being the recipient of nearly 10 percent of all funds paid out by the Pentagon in 2013.\" The curiously capitalized company, evidently run and funded by a single German entrepreneur, launched the Powerstation 247 in March. The Florida-based firm touts the all-in-one nature of its creation -- it comes with all the necessary inverters and supporting hardware in one refrigerator-sized unit. That was a departure from all the companies that made a nice box and then left it to installers to figure out inverters and the rest of the wiring. (Tesla has since announced plans to include an inverter with new Powerwall units, but it's still not clear when that will actually ship.) The company website takes a homey approach to pitching the Powerstation. A smiling man in sandblasted jeans casually reclines against the large metal box, as an uncredited testimonial asserts, \"I am independent from utility companies, politics and rising electricity costs.\" This might not be the one that beats Tesla. That said, there aren't many battery startups in the Southeastern U.S., and there are a lot of grid reliability concerns in that region tied to extreme weather events. There might be a profitable niche in finding those local customers who have money and want to store clean power, but are overlooked by the companies focused on the more mature storage markets of California and Hawaii. This long-time Swiss battery maker moved into the U.S. with a new North America subsidiary in April. Leclanch stands out as one of the few lithium-ion cell manufacturers based in Europe, and one of the few not based in Asia. It also assembles the cells into modules and systems. It has been building batteries for more than a century, which will likely be a boon when competing with younger companies that are still fighting to prove their bankability. The heavy-equipment company has years of experience making diesel and gas generators, with a specialty in rugged systems for weak- or off-grid deployment. Now it's throwing storage into the mix. The Cat Microgrid, launched in May, combines thin-film solar panels, energy storage and diesel or gas gensets to keep the lights on in remote locations, like cell towers, mining sites and off-grid communities in emerging markets. \"The central piece is still a generator, and storage is added as a complementary technology that dramatically reduces diesel requirements,\" GTM Research's Manghani said. \"You can rely on storage for short-duration startup and ramping, and then shift to backup generation for much longer duration needs. It can definitely make the whole system more efficient and cleaner to operate.\" Caterpillar isn't looking to eliminate the fossil fuels just yet, then, but it does tout the solar and storage as a great way to reduce the fuel costs and harmful emissions. The gensets are there to kick on when solar and storage alone won't meet the load. The company still has money to make on those gensets, but it's laying the groundwork for seamlessly transitioning to post-fossil fuel offerings when the time is right. Whereas Sunrun added storage for the home,Borrego now provides it on a massive scale. This solar veteran serves utility-scale and large commercial and industrial clients, and will offer storage with third-party financing and an eventual \"storage PPA\" deal, the company said in October. \"The move to solar-plus-storage is very natural given that a lot of C&I customers are not just looking to reduce kilowatt-hours but kilowatt usage, to benefit from demand-charge mitigation and those savings,\" Manghani said. As I reported previously,Borrego has weathered a lot of storms that took down other solar companies along the way. Its entrance indicates the storage industry is looking more like a sure bet than a gamble. Borrego doesn't want to see its large-scale solar customers going to some other company for storage.  In November, parent company Daimler AG created Mercedes-Benz Energy Americas, LLC to sell stationary storage of all sizes to the U.S. market. Like Tesla, Mercedes has ramped up battery production for its electric vehicles, and now seeks to commercialize that technology as a standalone, stationary product. Daimler tapped former Sonnen, Inc. CEO Boris von Bormann to lead the effort, so he's coming with several years of practice at translating a German storage product for American customers. Here, though, he'll be working with much broader institutional backing, and a brand that has already achieved widespread recognition. \"An average homeowner may not invest time in looking at all the different spec sheets available across the market, and may just go with the name they are familiar with,\" Manghani said. \"Mercedes-Benz is a brand name the average customer is very familiar with.\" Just how competitive this newcomer will be depends on how much the systems cost, and those details have not yet been released. That info should be coming soon, though, because we've entered 2017.", "theme": "Energy Storage", "title": "Heres Every Company That Entered the US Energy Storage Game in 2016", "comments": "8", "tags": ["borrego solar", "brightbox", "caterpillar", "leclanch\u00e9", "lockheed martin", "mercedes-benz", "orison", "solar plus storage", "sonnen", "sunrun", "tesla"]}
{"body": " New York Times:FBI Arrests Volkswagen Executive on Conspiracy Charges in Emissions Scandal The Federal Bureau of Investigation has arrested a Volkswagen executive who faces charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, two people with knowledge of the arrest said on Sunday, marking an escalation of the criminal investigation into the automakers diesel emissions cheating scandal. Oliver Schmidt, who led Volkswagens regulatory compliance office in the United States from 2014 to March 2015, was arrested on Saturday by investigators in Florida and is expected to be arraigned on Monday in Detroit, said the two people, a law enforcement official and someone familiar with the case. After a study by West Virginia University first raised questions over Volkswagens diesel motors in early 2014, Mr. Schmidt played a central role in trying to convince regulators that excess emissions were caused by technical problems rather than by deliberate cheating. Much of the data presented to regulators was fabricated, officials of the California Air Resources Board have said. USA Today: VW Reboots Microbus as Self-Driving Vehicle Volkswagen has rebooted its old microbus yet again, this time as a long-range electric vehicle. The concept vehicle was being shown Sunday ahead of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It's yet to be seen if it will be produced. The Volkswagen I.D. Buzz concept -- yes, that's the name -- has a range up to 270 miles per charge, which would put in it the heart of Tesla's capability and about 30 miles better than General Motor's new Chevrolet Bolt, which just went on sale. VW also says its concept would be the first \"multi-purpose vehicle,\" er, minivan, to be fully capable of driving itself. Venture Beat:How Blockchain Is Impacting Clean Energy Several startups are developing projects that integrate blockchain and solar energy. Their ideas range from developing alt-coins for trading and incentivizing power production to using smart contracts for administering energy transactions. SolarCoin is an eco-minded cryptocurrency that aims to incentivize solar power production. The coin was launched in 2014 and hopes to drive the generation of 97,500 terawatt-hours' worth of solar power over 40 years. It originally used a proof-of-work system for verification but has since switched over to a proof-of-stake-time system because it is more environmentally friendly. Anyone can mine the coins, from individuals to solar farms. For every 1 MWh of electricity generated (and verified by a third party), the producer receives one SolarCoin. Solar farms wanting to earn extra income by generating SolarCoins for the power they produce dont have to pay anything to participate, and SolarCoin does not take any of the power; it merely provides the coins as an incentive to produce clean energy. Digital Journal: Israel Will Soon Have the World's Tallest Solar Power Tower Construction of the world's tallest solar power tower is underway in Israel's sun-drenched Negev desert. The 820-foot (250 meters) tower will stand in the middle of a 121-megawatt concentrated solar complex, slated to begin operations by the end of 2017. The Ashalim Solar Thermal Power Station is being built and will be operated by Megalim Solar Power Ltd. General Electric is responsible for the engineering behind the project, while BrightSource is providing the advanced solar field technology.

{"body": " In his first term, President Obama made clean energy and grid modernization a core part of his plan for revitalizing the U.S. economy. For decades, political leaders flirted with renewables as a way to make the country energy independent -- but it was the first time that a president succeeded at making renewables an economic growth engine. In his second term, the president shifted his attention to climate change. It became a legacy issue for him. The steady advancement ofrenewables allowed Obama to make the case that lowering carbon emissions offers an immediate economic benefit, not just a hedge against long-term catastrophe. Federal emissions standards were crafted. And, consequently, a landmark global climate agreement was established. And with just over a week left as president, Obama is making his final case for the importance of the low-carbon energy transition. He's both taking a bow and making a plea. In a piece published in Science magazine this morning, President Obama outlined the economic argument in favor of decarbonizing the energy sector. \"This should not be a partisan issue. It is good business and good economics to lead a technological revolution and define market trends. And it is smart planning to set long-term emission-reduction targets and give American companies, entrepreneurs, and investors certainty so they can invest and manufacture the emission-reducing technologies that we can use domestically and export to the rest of the world,\" he wrote. When Obama took office, he was much more cautious about the economic tradeoffs of addressing climate change. But the last eight years have brought radical changes to America's energy landscape. Wind, natural gas and solar made up 97 percent of electricity capacity additions in 2015. One in 80 jobs since 2009 were created in solar. And since 2008, the cost of wind has fallen 41 percent, the cost of utility-scale solar has fallen 64 percent, and the cost of lithium-ion batteries have fallen 73 percent. In addition, a majority of states are decoupling their carbon emissions from economic growth. These developments make it much easier to lower climate pollution in a cost-effective way, argued Obama. \"The mounting economic and scientific evidence leave me confident that trends toward a clean-energy economy that have emerged during my presidency will continue and that the economic opportunity for our country to harness that trend will only grow.\" Of course, the president can't take credit for all the market and policy factors that contributed to those changes over the years. But his early commitment to the sector -- particularly support for clean energy as part of the stimulus package -- made the sector a core part of America's national economic policy. That vision filtered down to states and municipalities, which will continue to decarbonize no matter what federal policy looks like under a Trump presidency. The president also stressed the importance of upholding international climate commitments, which his administration brokered last year. President-elect Trump has repeatedly threatened to abandon America's climate goals. \"Were the United States to step away from Paris, it would lose its seat at the table to hold other countries to their commitments, demand transparency, and encourage ambition. This does not mean the next Administration needs to follow identical domestic policies to my Administrations. There are multiple paths and mechanisms by which this country can achieve -- efficiently and economically -- the targets we embraced in the Paris Agreement,\" wrote Obama. Obama only mentioned Donald Trump's name once. He encouraged the incoming president to keep an open mind about how to address the threat of climate change. There are lots of pathways, he argued. \"Of course, one of the great advantages of our system of government is that each president is able to chart his or her own policy course. And President-elect Donald Trump will have the opportunity to do so. The latest science and economics provide a helpful guide for what the future may bring, in many cases independent of near-term policy choices, when it comes to combating climate change and transitioning to a clean-energy economy,\" he wrote. Speaking at MIT this morning, Secretary of State John Kerry echoed the president's argument:\"The truth is that climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue. It's an issue that all of us should care about, regardless of political affiliation. [...] It's going to be innovators, researchers, entrepreneurs, and business leaders...who will continue to create the technological advances that forever revolutionize the way we power our world.\" Read the full article in Science magazinehere.

While smart home could probably describe the offerings over half of the thousands of exhibitors spread out across the acres of CES floor space, this section was filled with many companies that are using home wireless networks, connected devices, and yes, sometimes your homes electricity consumption, to make houses operate more conveniently, more comfortably and in a more environmentally friendly manner. However, long gone are the days when companies were trying to sell standalone dashboards and devices that specifically deliver homeowners a play-by-play account of their energy consumption.

Today, many companies have learned that most consumers only want such energy monitoring services if theyre being used for a specific reason, like automatically making a homes temperature more comfortable and convenient, enabling solar panels to be used more effectively, or adding awareness about what family members are doing throughout a home. After braving the crowds, the long taxi lines and the subpar casino food, we bring you five trends from CES that are informing the smart energy home of the future. 1) Solar and smart energy: Odds are that if your home has solar panels on the rooftop, youre going to want to understand how much energy theyre generating and how much energy your home is consuming. The difference could be the amount you could earn, or the amount you might be paying to your utility. A solar customer has also already agreed to spend on solar panels, so the leap to adding extra smart energy home tech isnt all that great. For solar companies, energy management and monitoring services are a bright spot. At CES, home solar installer Vivint Solar -- which had a particularly challenging 2016 -- showed off connected home services in partnership with Vivint Smart Home (a separate company, but one that shares the Vivint name). The companies built out an entire home, complete with roof, walls, doors and appliances. The two companies took the opportunity presented by the big tech show to announce that all new Vivint Solar solar customers will get an energy management system, a control panel, a thermostat and other home sensors for free. All of those devices can be controlled and optimized by Sky, Vivint Smart Homes home assistant that collects data from sensors and uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to make suggestions and automatically fine-tunes parts of the home for the occupant. Theres an average of 12 sensors for every install, Bryan Christiansen, COO of Vivint Solar, told Greentech Media, and these sensors determine if a family is home, away, coming, going, asleep or on vacation. Each of these occupancy models determines how Sky monitors or changes the home in terms of lights, locks or thermostat. If the homeowner is focused on energy consumption, they can get close to net zero or even all the way there, says Jeff Lyman, Vivint Smart Homes chief marketing officer. The data can come together and deliver a potent cocktail of energy savings, he explained. Vivint Solar was one of the few solar installers with a presence at CES. A short walk from Vivint Solars assembled CES house, startup SolPad was showing off its product (also called the SolPad) but thats a pretty different type of solar and energy product entirely. 2) Electricity draw equals family awareness: One of the growing trends from both startups and large companies alike at CES is using the monitoring of home electricity to deliver services around family awareness. Basically energy sensors, combined with algorithms, can alert Mom and Dad when Junior comes home and starts using the Xbox or when the garage door opens. A Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup called Sense, which had a booth in the startup section of CES, has built a device that connects to the breakers in a homes electrical panel. The current sensors in Senses device can determine which appliances, devices, or rooms in a home are consuming electricity, and can send this information to a cellphone app. The energy industry calls this peek into device use \"energy disaggregation.\" While Sense, which is selling its device for $299, can use the info to tell consumers what in their home is using how many watts, the company also focuses on how its information can deliver family services to its users. For example, a Sense user can get an alert when the laundry is done, or when the kids have watched several hours of TV. Other companies are also focused on using energy disaggregation for services, but a company like PlotWatt looks more at small businesses, and Bidgely provides services for utilities. Companies all across the Smart Home section of CES advertised awareness using various types of sensors and energy monitoring from Honeywell, Qorvo (which recently bought GreenPeak), Zmodo, to Elgato, which offers a product called \"Eve.\" 3) Smart lights need to be simple: At a kickoff event at the beginning of CES called Unveiled, up-and-coming startups and big companies alike show off their latest buzzy devices inside one ballroom in the hopes that the media will showcase their goods. One thing that surprised me at the event -- other than a person on a Segway dressed as a wisecracking robot -- was the amount of smart lighting companies that filled the room. I discovered Soraa there, and its new consumer light that it claims to be healthier and more convenient. There was also Osrams multicolored, Bluetooth-enabled bulb (A19) that connects with Apples Home app and Siri. At the same time, lighting company Lutron announced that its gear now works with Samsungs SmartThings platform and Nests motion-detector video camera. A crowd-funded lamp called Fluxo was on display as well; it can do something called paint light, or basically move the lamps lighting around in a room by using the paint gesture on a cellphone app. CES usually doesnt get a lot of lighting product announcements -- usually those are reserved for events like Lightfair International, which happens in Vegas later in the year. But now that lights can be connected and controlled with Apple and Google software, the consumer electronics show is starting to see an influx of these goods. The one thing that consumer-focused smart lighting companies really need to remember is to make these devices and services as simple as possible. Ive heard countless complaints that adding connectivity to lights has only made them more complicated. Companies like Soraa dont connect lighting to the internet (without an additional device) because they dont want the light system to stop working if the Wi-Fi goes down. Similar considerations should be made for ease of installation and working with partner devices. 4) Tech for better air and water: Beyond energy, other resources are beginning to draw the attention of the tech industry -- air and water. Particularly in countries and cities with air pollution problems, like China, indoor and outdoor air detection and purification systems are starting to gain more widespread adoption. Korean company Coway showed off a series of connected air purifiers at CES that can be controlled by voice using Amazons Alexa. Coway also sells various connected water purifiers. Other methods of cleaning air at CES were a little more unusual. French startup Wair has developed a smart scarf that keeps cyclists lungs clean and can be paired with a cellphone app. Another French company called Smart & Blue have created a showerhead called Hydrao that uses integrated LED lights to change the color of the water spray coming out of a shower. The shower moves from green to blue to purple to red as the user consumes more water in the shower. Its a way to gamify your shower for conservation. 5) Batteries, the quiet workhorses of CES: Big home batteries, like the kind that Tesla sells, are still not being widely advertised at places like CES. The value proposition to the homeowner just isnt quite there yet. Perhaps that will change as companies continue to lower the costs of home batteries, as Tesla is trying to do by 30 percent. But across the rest of CES, smart devices -- whether theyre in the home, the car, or worn on the wrist -- are using the latest lithium-ion batteries as the core energy source to store electricity charged by the grid. While there were few next-gen battery innovations being showed off at CES, Panasonic displayed a flexible lithium-ion battery under development for wearables. Panasonics bendable battery can enable designers to make wearables with better, sleeker or more interesting shapes. The batteries are slim enough to be embedded in a credit card. Other tech companies were highly focused on building the latest processors or software that can make sure devices are using batteries as efficiently as possible. Qualcomm debuted its latest Snapdragon 835 mobile chip that the company says consumes 25 percent less power than its previous chip.", "theme": "Smart Homes/Smart Buildings", "title": "5 Trends for the Smart Energy Home of the Future", "comments": "18", "tags": ["ces 2017", "home energy management", "panasonic", "sense", "smart home", "soraa", "vivint"]}
{"body": " T.J. Rodgers, founder of Cypress Semiconductor, and John Doerr, chairman of Kleiner Perkins, have emerged as white knight saviors for troubled solar microinverter firm Enphase. The Silicon Valley icons are investing $10 million in the firm, and Rodgers is joining the board of directors. It's a bit of an unusual move for this odd couple. Kleiner was an investor in Enphase under the usual order of things, back when it was a startup. Doerr has invested in some of venture capital's most famous successes (Google, Amazon, Sun, Intuit), as well as in some less than successful efforts (GO Corporation, MyCFO, Segway). He spearheaded KPCB's investment efforts in greentech, including funding Silver Spring Networks, Fisker Automotive, Bloom Energy, Opower and Proterra. He has been an adviser to the Obama administration. Here are the takeaways from Enphase's most recent quarterly financial results. Enphase just sold the recently acquired O&M business of Next Phase Solar for an undisclosed amount. Enphase is also putting an enormous amount of faith in the rapid growth of the Australian energy storage market. Recently, Enphase \"entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with FBR Capital Markets & Co.\" as sales agent to sell shares of common stock \"having an aggregate offering price of up to $17,000,000.\" An Enphase representative notes, \"The 8K only enables Enphase to raise capital in the future, and only if and when the company chooses to do so.\" The ATM is there to define the terms under which any future stock issuances might be made, signaling that if or when Enphase issues shares against the Shelf, the shares will be issued \"at the money.\" As we've reported, Enphase is faced with a ticking clock that requires the company to hit profitability while ramping two new product lines (its AC battery and sixth-generation microinverter) and keeping its inventory down while managing its working capital. It's a precarious position for one of solar's early success stories. Enphase was a well-managed VC-funded startup that created a new market, grew exceedingly fast and made it through the IPO window. Perhaps Rodgers and Doerr know how to turn Enphase around.

{"body": " New York Times:Cuomo Confirms Deal to Close Indian Point Nuclear Plant The Indian Point nuclear power plant north of New York City has been supplying low-cost electricity to the metropolitan area for more than 50 years. But to hear Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo tell it, New Yorkers will hardly miss Indian Point. Mr. Cuomo announced on Monday that the state had reached an agreement with the plants operator, Entergy, to shut it down by April 2021. He minimized the effects the closure would have on the power grid, electric bills, workers and the regional economy. In his State of the State address in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Cuomo characterized the deal as a hard bargain he had driven to rid the region of a ticking time bomb less than 30 miles from Midtown. He said the state would bear no costs in the shutdown or decommissioning of the plants two operating nuclear reactors. Washington Examiner: 600 Companies Plead With Trump to Uphold Paris Climate Agreement More than 600 U.S. companies are urging President-elect Trump to uphold the Paris climate agreement once he takes office, and are calling for the continuance of low-carbon initiatives as a way to ensure a slower rise of the global temperature. \"All parts of society have a role to play in tackling climate change, but policy and business leadership is crucial,\" Lars Petersson, president of Ikea U.S., said in a statement. \"The Paris Agreement was a bold step toward a cleaner, brighter future, and must be protected.\" MarketWatch:A 2-Year Streak of U.S. Oil Output Declines Is 'Likely Over' The U.S. Energy Information Administration warned Tuesday that the nearly two-year streak of overall declines in U.S. oil production may be over, raising its forecast on production for this year and predicting a year-on-year output climb for 2018. The EIA forecasts domestic oil production of 9 million barrels a day this year, up from the December forecast of 8.78 million and an estimated 2016 output level of 8.89 million, according to the governments latest monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook Report. For 2018, its initial forecast stands at 9.3 million barrels a day. MIT Technology Review:Why Some Autonomous Cars Are Going to Avoid the Internet Self-driving cars are essentially large computers on wheels. No surprise, then, that some of them will be kept offline in the name of security. John Krafcik, the CEO of Alphabets self-driving car company, Waymo, explained to the Financial Timesthat its vehicles only occasionally connect to the internet. Our cars communicate with the outside world only when they need to, so there isnt a continuous line thats able to be hacked, going into the car, he told the newspaper. Jalopnik:Here's What Happened With Faraday Future's Failed Self-Driving Demo Faraday Futures car failed to park itself on stage at its big debut at CES last week. Oddly, at the same event, the much-anticipated FF 91 successfully parked itself outside the event building. As it turns out, the car inside was up to something different, as explained by the cars engineers. Those engineers said the car inside was running on its own specific programming, different from the normal-functioning self-driving prototype outside -- though the two shared software and hardware. FF does have a solid and functioning self-driving, self-parking system, but thats not what was used during the big indoor demo, and it all kind of served to undermine the cars abilities.", "theme": "Other Energy", "title": "NY Plans Closure of Major Nuclear Plant: There Is Not Enough Carbon-Free Energy to Replace", "comments": "7", "tags": ["editors news feed", "indian point", "nuclear power"]}
{"body": " Last week, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz presented the Obama administrations final wish list to the incoming Trump administration, in the form of the second installment of its Quadrennial Energy Review. QER 1.2, as its called, is the highest-level public statement from the outgoing Obama administration on its energy priorities and policies, with 76 recommendations focused on securing and modernizing the electric grid. Much of the news coverage has focused on the reports cybersecurity warnings and calls to action -- specifically, its citation of Russian-orchestrated cyberattacks on a Ukrainian utility as an indicator of what is possible\" for the U.S. grid. Its an important topic, given the reports by U.S. intelligence agencies of Russian hacking into the recently concluded election, and the ultimately false, though thought-provoking, reports this month of a hacked laptop at Vermont utility Burlington Electric. But QER 1.2 also contains a long list of Energy Department ideas for modernizing the grid. Some of them come with big price tags -- $350 billion and $500 billion required to upgrade grid infrastructure nationwide, increased funding for nuclear power, or the tens of billions of dollars its seeking to invest from its loan guarantee program. Others are cheaper, like programs to educate local and state utilities on technology and policy, or employment development programs to help replace the aging utility workforce. Distributed energy is also an area of focus, with a proposal to significantly expand existing programs to demonstrate the integration and optimization of distribution system technologies, and extending cybersecurity planning and standards to include distribution and behind-the-meter assets. The first version of the QER, released in April 2015, called for $3.5 billion in investment to modernize and strengthen the power grid, amidst a total of 63 proposals for the electricity, oil and gas, and transportation sectors. Of those, 21 were fully or partially enacted into law and 29 were implemented by the Obama administration. At Fridays event, Secretary Moniz made the case for bipartisan support in Congress to push these new proposals forward. It's unlikely that DOEs new ideas can expect the same success rate with President-elect Donald Trump, incoming DOE secretary Rick Perry, a DOE transition team thats already asking for the names of climate-change researchers, and a U.S. Congress controlled by the Republican Party. In light of these realities, many of the suggestions coming from last weeks report are couched in terms of expanding existing DOE programs, or subtly altering others to gain support from industry partners, particularly utilities. Take its concept for DOEs Title XVII loan guarantee program, which has loaned about $32 billion to mostly successful renewable energy funding (but is best known publicly for its $535 million loan to failed solar panel maker Solyndra). The program, which recently reported that its portfolio has paid about $1.65 billion in interest payments to the U.S. Treasury, still has about $40 billion allocated for loans. But its easy to see how the Trump administration might be opposed to supporting a program that loans money to solar companies. While Congress would have to act to end the program entirely, the Energy Secretary could simply stop signing off on new loans, effectively killing it. This may be why the DOEs latest suggestions for the Title XVII program ask for changes that would allow it to expand beyond generation projects secured by power-purchase agreements, and into grid modernization financing by regulated entities, that is, utilities. Heres how the report described it: Some of the benefits of grid modernization are realized over time, as the electricity system itself is changed by technology and market innovations. Additional funding resources would bridge the gap between investment costs and realization of benefits and would enable utilities to invest in grid modernization. A relatively low-cost permanent Federal financing system could be established by setting up a revolving loan fund with one-time seed capital. Much of the need behind this change in loan program rules is driven by the anticipated need for new technologies at the transmission-grid level, the report said. By their nature, transmission projects, especially big projects, involve many entities and jurisdictions, adding that statutory clarification is needed on indirect lending authorities to such entities. At the same time, DOE has already earmarked $1 billion in loans for programs that combine distributed energy assets and technologies, including one centered on advanced fossil fuels, as well as another focused on renewable energy and energy efficiency. DOE is also running an important set of distributed energy and distribution grid projects, largely under the aegis of federal labs, including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and through its cutting-edge technology grant program, ARPA-E. As part of its QER process, DOE in early 2016 released a grid modernization multi-year plan that called for $220 million to support 80-plus projects of this type across the country. These types of programs, unlike those focused on climate change or renewable energy, havent been specifically targeted for opposition from the Trump administration. Instead, theyre mostly grid-centric -- and under DOEs latest proposal, they should be leveraged to help utilities demonstrate advanced distribution system technologies at the community scale. The list of technologies included advanced voltage control/optimization systems; dynamic protection schemes to manage reverse power flows, communications, sensors, storage, switching and smart-inverter networks; and advanced distribution management systems, including automated substations. The program envisioned would support cost-share programs to inform standards and regulations and increase regulatory and utility confidence in key technologies or technology systems. Utilities would have to make a positive business case and obtain regulatory approvals, with preference for multi-utility partnerships with diverse customer profiles. And, of course, Cybersecurity plans for all projects would be required and supported by programmatic review of plans and deployments.", "theme": "Regulation & Policy", "title": "The Quadrennial Energy Review Offers a Plan for Grid ModernizationIf Trumps Team Wants It", "comments": "3", "tags": ["arpa-e", "department of energy", "distributed energy", "distribution grid", "ernest moniz", "grid modernization", "renewable energy", "transmission", "trump"]}

But while the Obama administration and other world leaders have aggressively pursued efforts to slash carbon dioxide emissions and stave off global warming, the former ExxonMobil chief executive expressed little such urgency when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Capitol Hill Wednesday. Asked by Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) about his personal position on climate change, Tillerson said he formed his views over about 20 years as an engineer and a scientist, understanding the evolution of the science. Ultimately, he said, he concluded that increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere are having an effect on the earths climate.

Bloomberg:Putin's Other American Propaganda Effort: Anti-Fracking News Energy politics makes strange bedfellows, none stranger than Robin Hood and Russian President Vladimir Putin. RT, a media organization that the U.S. intelligence community calls \"the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet,\" published an article on Jan. 2 under the unlikely headline: Robin Hoods Sherwood Forest hideout under threat from frackers. The article, which carries no byline and cites the work of environmental activists, laments plans of a unit of Ineos Group, a Switzerland-based chemical company, to conduct seismic testing for natural gas near Major Oak, the millennium-old tree that served in legend as headquarters to Robin Hood and his merry fellows.

Energy Post: Energy Efficiency Rate Has to Double to Meet Climate Targets The annual improvement in energy efficiency has slowed down from 1.6% in the period 2000-2008 to 1.3% in 2009-2015, according to a comprehensive new report published by the World Energy Council and the French public agency ADEME. To meet the Paris climate targets, the rate should double to 2.5% per year to 2030, saysFranois Moisan, scientific director of ADEME. According to Moisan, price signals are key to achieving this goal, although supporting policies are also required. He believes the global spread of smart meters represent the biggest single opportunity to step up energy savings.

{"body": " As of January 1, all new buildings of 10 stories or fewer in San Francisco must be built with solar panels included. Since that local measure passed last spring, its author, Scott Wiener, moved from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to the state senate. Now, he's bringing the concept to Sacramento, first in summary form, with the full proposed legislation expected in four to six weeks. If adopted, mandatory rooftop solar legislation would set a groundbreaking example of how a legislature can expand distributed solar through less conventional means, diverging from the default models of renewable portfolio standards and tax credits. That outcome is by no means guaranteed, though. The process of passing the legislation through the state legislature will likely raise new questions about how the policy would impact the entirety of the massive Golden State. There are more legislators to convince than in San Francisco, and more interest groups and industry lobbyists who may try to stop it. \"The state, of course, is much bigger and much more diverse geographically and in every other respect,\" Wiener told GTM. \"We are actively soliciting input to make sure were crafting legislation that will work for the whole state.\" For any other state, requiring solar photovoltaics or solar thermal on most new buildings would seem dramatic, if not unthinkable. For California, however, it's the latest iteration of a legislative program years in the making. Most pertinently, the state already has a law requiring 15 percent of the roof space on most types of new buildings to be left \"solar ready,\" meaning it is clear of obstructions and easy to cover with panels. With that on the books, it's not a huge leap to require builders to actually fill those spaces. Last year, the legislature passed an ambitious new climate change target:The state must now cut its carbon emissions to 40 percent below 1990 rates by 2030, even as the population continues to grow. That accelerated pace will force drastic measures across numerous sectors of the economy. Requiring solar on new houses would ensure that additional construction doesn't add much more carbon to the atmosphere. The rooftop solar requirement doesn't just increase the total number of systems deployed, as I reported in June. Placing the onus on the developer thus removes two of the biggest stumbling blocks to residential solar: customer acquisition and financing. Of course, that does force a cost onto developers, who then pass it on to the homebuyers. The cost of a solar system scarcely registers in San Francisco, where the median home sales price approached $1.2 million in recent months. That picture changes if you head over to the Central Valley city of Bakersfield, where the median home price is $217,000, according to real estate website Trulia. With prices like that, the cost of a solar system could conceivably come to constitute a meaningful percentage of the overall home price. \"The cost of a house is what the market will bear,\" Wiener said. \"The cost of rooftop solar is not a significant part of development costs. It's becoming less and less, and it pays for itself over time.\" That ability to pay for itself over a few years makes the solar requirement more of a help than a hindrance for lower-income homebuyers, solar advocates say. Additional building costs will be more than made up in electricity bill savings, with decades of homegrown clean energy being produced,\" said Susannah Churchill, West Coast regional director for Vote Solar, a nonprofit solar energy advocacy group. \"That will be especially helpful for lower-income Californians, who as a group spend more on energy bills proportional to their income.\" It's worth noting that rooftop solar requirements were enacted in the less exorbitantly priced California cities of Lancaster, Sebastopol and Santa Monica before San Francisco, so the policy has seen some geographic diversity already. Additionally, the requirement would not directly affect existing housing stock, as it only applies to brand-new builds. But the policy still poses a dilemma familiar to other green building mandates: It forces customers to shoulder a higher upfront cost in order to save money in the long run. The question for California legislators is whether they think that's a fair trade to make. A policy that launches seamlessly in San Francisco can have very different effects throughout the 160,000 or so square miles of California. Beyond ensuring homebuyers aren't hampered by such a measure, Wiener will have to make the case that the policy makes sense for new buildings everywhere in the state. It's not all new buildings, by the way. The statewide proposal will echoexceptionsin the city measure for buildings where solar would not be viable for a variety of reasons. It also gives the option of choosing solar PV or solar thermal, which can be more attractive in certain buildings based on their heating load. The San Francisco measure didn't draw much resistance from the development community, Wiener said. As he prepared to announce the state measure, he spoke with several building trade groups to alert them it was happening and include them in the process. (Developers haven't taken a public stance on the measure, as the final language has not been released). There's also a question of what effect such a policy would have on the grid itself. The state authorized nearly 100,000 new housing units in 2015, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Early fears of a utility \"death spiral\" caused by customers defecting to rooftop PV have proven to be overblown, but if most of those new homes, as well as new mid-sized commercial structures, don't consume much power from the grid, that would have an effect on macro-level consumption trends. One potential outcome is to avoid a lot of new generation costs that ratepayers would otherwise have to subsidize. That's something voters could get behind, whether or not the utilities are thrilled about it. The extent of the public's appetite for this measure will become clearer in the months to come. \"This is a big step forward, but this is not something out of left field,\" Wiener said. \"Weve been moving in this direction for a while, so this step makes sense.\"", "theme": "Residential Solar", "title": "Mandatory Solar on Newly Built Roofs Could Be Coming to All of California", "comments": "77", "tags": ["california", "death spiral", "rooftop solar", "san francisco", "solar", "solar pv", "solar thermal", "utilities"]}

{"body": " In late December, the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada approved the restoration of retail-rate net metering for home solar customers served by of Sierra Pacific Power Company, a subsidiary of NV Energy. The decision followed a year of policy debates and public outcry over a 2015 order to phase out the net metering credit and increase fixed fees on rooftop solar customers. The debates are not over yet. Last week, NV Energy requested that the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) reverse its decision to allow for up to 6 megawatts of new rooftop solar capacity under the old, more favorable net metering policy -- a change made as part of Sierra Pacific's general rate case. The utility stated that restoring net metering for solar customers throws out $2.92 million in annual bill savings, for a total of $8.77 million over the three-year rate period, intended for the broad base of northern Nevada electric customers. The December 2016 PUCN order directs NV Energy to reallocate this savings to future new solar net metering customers (1,250 if all residential), according to a press release issued on January 12. In its filing made today, the company argues that the December order takes the savings that were intended for a larger customer base and directs them to this small subset of future solar net metering customers.  NV Energy also claimed that applying cost savings to a single class of private solar NEM customers is inconsistent with an October 2016 agreement reached with the Regulatory Operations Staff of the PUCN, the Bureau of Consumer Protection, Northern Nevada Industrial Electric Users, Northern Nevada Utility Customers, Newmont Mining, a coalition of local governmental entities, Nevadans for Clean Affordable Reliable Energy and Vote Solar.  The filing acknowledged the difficult position Nevada utility regulators find themselves in. NV Energy also praised the PUCN for noting the following in the December order: The PUCN also noted, however, that the earlier decision to phase out net metering all but crushed the rooftop solar industry in northern Nevada and is incongruous with existing law (SB 374) and public intent -- which the NV Energy statement did not address. Nevada regulators cited a recent report by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners that found cost-shifting at some level is unavoidable in practical rate design. At the same time, the PUCN noted that unreasonable cost-shifting is not acceptable. Based on Sierra Pacifics figures, adding 6 megawatts of new rooftop solar capacity under the old net metering rates would result in a cost shift of 26 cents per month. Meanwhile, the October agreement to save Northern Nevada ratepayers $2.92 million per year is expected to reduce customer bills by an average of 27 cents per month. So, based on utility figures alone, the average residential Sierra Pacific customer will still save 1 cent per month with the return of net metering, regulators wrote. This calculation allowed the PUCN to conclude that any cost-shift that may exist based on Sierra Pacifics assessments is reasonable. How customers will react in light of NV Energy's new filing remains to be seen. Rooftop solar enjoys strong public support in Nevada, but the net metering debate pits solar and non-solar customers against each other on an issue both groups care deeply about: their pocketbooks. The PUCN has 40 days to grant or deny NV Energys latest request. Regardless of the outcome, all sides will have other opportunities to address the net metering issue. In June, the PUCN is expected to address net metering in the general rate case for Nevada Power, NV Energys subsidiary serving the southern, more populous portion of the state. The PUCNs December order also stated that further study of NEM is necessary to find the appropriate balance for Nevada. According to the PUCN website, regulators opened a docket (17-01011) on January 3, 2017 regarding a universally acceptable methodology for the valuation of net energy metering rooftop solar in Nevada to be used in future proceedings.

The announcement, made by Chinas National Energy Administration, cancels 103 projects that were planned or under construction, eliminating 120 gigawatts of future coal-fired capacity. That includes dozens of projects in 13 provinces, mostly in Chinas coal-rich north and west, on which construction had already begun.

Christian Science Monitor:Why the EPA Nominee Could Be a Political Wrecking Ball When new presidents come to the White House, the pendulum of federal environmental action tends to swing, and under Donald Trump it may take an unusually wide shift -- seen especially in passing responsibility to the states. State empowerment stands out like no other theme as a guiding light for Scott Pruitt, who faces a confirmation hearing today as President-elect Trumps nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitts strict interpretation of the United States Constitution, and of the limits of federal authority, undergirds his track record of challenging major EPA regulations as unconstitutional power grabs, while serving as Oklahomas attorney general.

The move, announced just three days before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, brings the total support from the United States to the fund to $1 billion and solidifies Obamas efforts to combat the phenomenon during his administration, which he has called the greatest long-term threat facing the world. Obama pledged in 2014 to contribute $3 billion in total funding by the end of the decade, despite deep opposition from Republicans in Congress. But the president was able to circumvent congressional approval, and both this payment and last years were funded through the State Department.

{"body": " Georgia Power doesnt just want to keep the lights on anymore. Increasingly, the Southern utility wants to build on its relationship with customers, and earn the title of trusted energy advisor. On August 1, Georgia Power launched the Georgia Power Marketplace, an e-commerce website offering a suite of energy-saving products from smart thermostats to LED lighting. The platform is designed to integrate with customers electricity accounts so that rebates can be applied instantly, making the purchase of home upgrades faster and more affordable. Currently available rebates include $100 off of the Nest Learning Thermostat and 20 percent to 30 percent off of LED lighting options. The platform offers customers new products and services that take their experience with us to the next level, said Jeff Smith, energy efficiency strategy and implementation manager for Georgia Power. The intent of the marketplace is for us to grow in that trusted adviser role to our customers, he said. If they grow and become more technologically savvy, we want to grow with them. We want to have multiple channels to interconnect with them and increase customer satisfaction. We want to make sure that we have simpler ways to [encourage] participation in our energy-efficiency programs. In the five months since the platform launched, there have been more than 400,000 visits to the site and thousands of rebates redeemed through the marketplace. So far, the most popular products on the site have been smart and learning thermostats, LED lighting kits and advanced power strips. The website also offers home automation products, smoke detectors and water saving devices. Georgia Power is still gathering data on the website usage, but anecdotal evidence is showing that it's a good relationship, and that customers are really liking what they're seeing, said Smith. Utilities across the U.S. and abroad have been grappling with how to evolve their business models as new customer-centric technologies have come to market and changed the way ratepayers use energy. Georgia Power and its parent Southern Company have been on the leading edge of reshaping the way utilities interact with consumers. E-commerce platforms in particular have emerged as an important way for utilities to engage with customers and find new revenue streams (as we've covered). The Georgia Power marketplace isnt the utilitys first attempt at expanding its reach into home. In the summer of 2015, the utility launched a home solar sales platform designed to help customers assess their solar potential and select from a list of vetted installers, including Georgia Powers deregulated arm, Georgia Power Energy Services. Georgia Power launched its solar business shortly after regulators passed legislation to allow for solar leasing and power-purchase agreements. Our residential solar servicecontinues to fulfill our goal of helping customers determine if solar is right for them, spokesperson Jacob Hawkins wrote in an email. It is an education, consultation and installation service program -- if a customer wants to purchase solar after their consultation, we want to be able to provide accurate information to make an informed decision. If the customer is interested in installation, we will offer the option to purchase it from us. Since the launch of the solar program, Georgia Power has logged 15,000 visits to the solar web tool and completed consultations with more than 1,000 customers. But so far, the utility has only signed contracts with seven solar customers. Kim Greene, chief operating officer and executive vice president at Southern Company, said last summer that on-site solar is something folks just arent willing to commit to. Georgia Power electricity rates are also about 15 percent lower than the national average, which lengthens the payback period for solar and makes the investment less attractive. But Georgia does benefit from a lot of sun, and there are savings to be had. So its also possible that Georgia Power just hasnt yet been able to figure out the best way to win solar customers. Arguably, a regulated utility may not possess the in-house skill set or motivation to market solar in the most effective way. Then again, its still early days. Georgia Power is pioneering a new platform and testing out what works best. The Georgia Power Marketplace for home energy products is the utilitys next iteration of the concept, and could one day become an effective channel for selling solar. The new marketplace does not currently offer rooftop solar; potential Georgia Power customers still have to go through the solar portal. Smith didnt say if there are plans to merge the two platforms, but he did say there are plans to expand the number of marketplace offerings. I don't think we want to see this as a stagnant tool, he said. We want [the Georgia Power Marketplace] to evolve, and as new products and services come out that can benefit our customers, we would love to see this as one of many channels to offer [new products] to our customers and strengthen our relationship with them. For instance, Smith said Georgia Power is working closely with Nest on finding new ways to work together and update the marketplace as new technologies come to market. For Nest, the experience with Georgia Power has helped inform conversations with other utilities across the country. The marketplace concept has a lot of interest in it in the utility industry, but Georgia Power has been a leader in getting theirs launched, and has become a reference case for a lot of other utilities, said David Bend, head of East Coast energy partnerships for Nest. There's a real focus on keeping it simple for customers, and keeping Georgia Power in that trusted energy adviser role. Georgia Power first started working with Nest in 2015 with the launch of the Smart Usage Rate, a program that gives residential customers a free Nest thermostat for switching to a time-sensitive rate plan. The relationship has since evolved to include a suite of Nest products being offered via the Georgia Power Marketplace, including Nests indoor and outdoor security camera, as well as the Nest Protect, a combined carbon monoxide and smoke detector. Theres value for Nest in being included on Georgia Powers curated list of home products. At the same time, Georgia Power benefits from the relationship with an innovative and well-known technology partner. As customers express more interest in new and exciting home energy products, Georgia Power is prepared to serve them. Partnering with Nest [allows us to offer] solutions faster than they would have gotten to customers in the past, said Smith. It's been a win for us too, through that process. Separate from the marketplace, Georgia Power continues to offer Nest thermostats to customers who adopt the Smart Usage Rate, which has a time-of-use component and a demand-rate component. The goal of the program, said Smith, is to teach customers about staggering their energy use to reduce demand on the grid at peak times. The Nest thermostat was an effective marketing tool to help bring attention to the Smart Usage Rate, according to Smith. The type of customer to select a time-of-use/demand rate is likely to be technology-savvy and have an interest in learning how to manage their energy use and save money with new gadgets. Similar to the marketplace, Nest has been able to use its experience with Georgia Power to inform the companys work with other utilities. Theres a lot of interest industry-wide in new rate design structures, so we're thrilled to be a part of the Smart Usage Rate, said Bend. Georgia Power continues to look at different rate structures and opportunities to offer them, said Hawkins. We know that rates aren't a one-size-fits-all proposition, he said. We've offered time-of-use rates for a long time. As far as a time-flat bill and flex bill and various other rate structures, I think we're going to continue to look at that. The ability for customers to buy home energy management products online through their utility is likely to complement the adoption of new rate plans.", "theme": "Utilities", "title": "Georgia Power Marketplace Takes Customer Engagement to the Next Level", "comments": "0", "tags": ["energy efficiency", "georgia power", "led lighting", "marketplace", "nest thermostat", "rooftop solar"]}
{"body": " We are now just days away from the inauguration, and beyond boisterous campaign pledges to arrest the coal industrys decline and withdraw from the Paris Agreement, President-elect Donald Trumps scant energy and climate policies remain frustratingly obscure and inscrutable. But what we have not heard is just as worrisome. The Trump administration has given little indication of its support for perhaps the strongest economic driver in the American economy today: clean energy. While China opened the new year with a pledge to invest $361 billion in clean energy by 2020, the Trump administration has been largely silent on clean energy -- including the continuity of critical federal support for the ongoing clean energy boom. This is particularly troubling for energy-focused graduate and undergraduate students who will be the future leaders of Americas clean energy revolution. In the months since the election, concern that we would miss such a great economicopportunity has echoed throughout our campus, and throughout campuses across the country. To voice this concern, we have joined students representing the energy clubs of the business and public policy programs from across the country in an open letter to the Trump administration calling for greater leadership in supporting the jobs, businesses and benefits of clean energy. The Trump administration must recognize the economic power of clean energy. The industry now employs over 2.5 million people, 1.7 percent of the American workforce. The solar industry alone provided American workers with more than 200,000 well-paying jobs in 2015, growing 20 percent over 2014 and accounting for 1.2 percent of all new U.S. jobs created in 2015. A recent Department of Energy report puts the number of solar jobs even higher. The growth in employment was driven in part by increasing global investment in clean energy, which amounted to more than $329 billion last year, twice the investment in conventional power generation. This level of private-sector investment is even more remarkable considering that falling renewable energy costs make it cheaper to install the same amount of power as in previous years -- solar power costs have fallen 60 percent in the last 10 years. President-elect Trump may not continue all of the Obama administration policies that have helped make America a global leader in clean energy deployment and innovation. However, there are a number of programs we see as critical to maintaining American prosperity, job creation and global leadership in the energy industry. Our coalition of graduate students urges the Trump administration to support: These are commonsense proposals that will help Americas entrepreneurs, project developers and construction workers to seize a tremendous economic opportunity. Clean energy is an economic winner for the U.S., and we must harness its ability to create jobs, improve American infrastructure, and ensure that our country remains a global economic leader. As clean energy continues to grow, U.S. companies will be called upon to increase manufacturing capacity, train hundreds of thousands of American workers, and bring about a modern, secure electric grid. Embracing a clean energy future would boost manufacturing and construction across the U.S. with 460,000 additional construction jobs by 2030 and 800,000 by 2050. As students training to be the future leaders of the energy industry, we aspire to create successful businesses and millions of jobs. We need stronger clean energy leadership from the Trump administration to do so. *** Kristofer Holz is a joint MBA/MEM candidate at the Yale School of Management and the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies focusing on financial and policy innovation in the energy sector.

{"body": " Autonomous drones apparently aren't exciting enough for Amazon, so the online retail giant has also started work on developing self-driving vehicle technology for use on the ground. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has just granted Amazon a patent related to the coordination of autonomous vehicles on a roadway with reversible lanes. Say its rush hour and the lane directions over a bridge have changed -- its probably a good idea for the vehicle to know. Amazons proposed roadway management system is designed to monitor traffic flow and generate routing instructions for self-driving cars based on the roadway assignment. The central network would be able to give vehicles advance warning, instead of relying on visual cues to make a real-time decision.  Amazon illustration via USPTO The benefits of this technology could improve autonomous driving beyond lane management. Road Show reports, Having a central system sending out notifications to individual cars is a staple of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technology, which multiple automakers have expressed an interest in developing. Audi, for instance, recently unveiled its Traffic Light Information system, and BMW is integrating a traffic-light reader into new vehicle models (which I saw in action earlier this month). For Amazon, which bought thousands of its own tractor-trailers in December, autonomous vehicles could dramatically improve the speed and efficiency of package delivery -- and it could also eliminate the cost of hiring drivers. Rumor on the street is that Amazon is developing self-driving delivery vehicles out of its drone division, Prime Air. The company made its first drone delivery in December, dropping off popcorn and an Amazon Fire streaming device to a customer identified only as Richard B. In the event that a drone cant complete the delivery service, Amazon recently patented a system for delivering goods through underground tunnels.  Amazon illustration via USPTO Between the drones and tunnels, not to mention the bike couriers and flying fulfillment centers, Amazons plans to pursue autonomous trucking may be the companys most realistic new transport solution proposed to date. Theres no guarantee Amazon will do anything with its reversible lanes patent (the same is true of the patented network of mole-like conveyor belts). But the proposed roadway management system does confirm that Amazon is interested in the autonomous vehicle space, and could play a key role in shaping it. All major automakers and a growing number of tech giants are working on vehicle autonomy to some extent, including Uber, which recently launched a trucking arm following the acquisition of self-driving truck startup Otto. These developments are a big deal because automated vehicles are expected to play a critical role in reducing oil use and the corresponding emissions in the transportation sector -- which recently surpassed the electricity sector as the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. Driverless cars communicate with one another to avoid rapid acceleration and traffic jams, which both burn through fuel quickly. Vehicle automation is also particularly well suited to electric cars, which can recharge wirelessly to make vehicles truly autonomous. At the same time, the availability of self-driving features is likely to make electric vehicles even more attractive to consumers. Electric vehicle sales are growing, but still \"need something radical\" to reach mass scale, according to Robbie Diamond, CEO of the nonprofit Securing America's Future Energy, which recently published a set of recommendations for the rollout of autonomous vehicle technology. Realizing the benefits of autonomous vehicles depends on whether or not Amazon and others get the technology right. It depends on getting the rules around the vehicles right too.

In the days after, Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor, discovered that he would be no such thing -- that in fact, if confirmed by the Senate, he would become the steward of a vast national security complex he knew almost nothing about, caring for the most fearsome weapons on the planet, the United States nuclear arsenal.

Trump signed executive orders Tuesday advancing both the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline and the Dakota Access Pipeline, based on approvals. Trump separately signed an order requiring pipeline builders to use American steel. Additionally, he signed orders expediting environmental review and approval processes for high-priority infrastructure projects. \"There [are] other executive orders that speed up the environmental review process, and I believe that will open up the door to these other stalled projects going through,\" said Daniel Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas. Clifton said there are about 10 other energy projects, totaling $7 billion, that were turned down or held up since the Obama administration rejected the estimated $10 billion Keystone XL Pipeline in November 2015. Union of Concerned Scientists: What Will U.S. Energy Leadership Look Like at Rick Perrys Department of Energy? Theres a clear trend in the president-elects cabinet appointments -- many of them are opposed to the agencies they would lead. Some have demonstrated opposition to the particular agency and/or its mission in a professional capacity. Others have stated a desire to see the agency disappear altogether, suggesting the institution has no value. Rick Perrys appointment to head the Department of Energy (DOE) is certainly consistent with this trend; in a 2011 presidential debate he famously forgot the name of the agency he would abolish. And now hes been nominated to lead it. Why does it matter, and what should we expect? Greentech Lead: Energy Storage Tech Set to Grow in Emerging Markets: World Bank Group Energy storage technology will become more accessible in emerging markets in the coming decade, enabling a significant scale-up of renewable energy as a clean source of electricity generation, says new research from World Bank Group. The report commissioned by theIFC and the World Bank-administered Energy Sector Management Assistance Program projects a 40-fold increase in developing countries stationary energy storage capacity by 2025, with more than 80 gigawatts expected to be added over that time period to todays 2 GW of installed electricity storage capacity. Energy storage technology will be critical in the expansion of renewable energy in remote and rural areas that lack grid infrastructure or reliable electricity supplies, said IFC executive vice president and CEO Philippe Le Hourou. By dramatically expanding the capacity to store energy, these technologies will help countries meet their renewable energy targets, support the demand for clean energy, and help bring electricity to the 1.2 billion people who currently lack access, Le Hourou added. Business Wire: Alevo Set to Deliver First GridBank Providing Ancillary Services to PJM Alevo Group today announced that its first GridBank storage unit has been cleared for shipping and installation after completing an extensive factory acceptance testing process at Parker Hannifins Energy Grid-Tie Division. Alevo and Parker Hannifin have collectively conducted a series of validation and application tests on the 2 MW/1 MWh unit to verify the GridBanks performance based on safety, power, thermal stability, communications, response rates and ability to deliver specific applications. We have been testing the GridBank in conjunction with Alevo since August and are satisfied the unit operates as per its design intent, explained Jim Hoelscher, general manager of Parker Hannifins Energy Grid-Tie Division in Charlotte. Parker has conducted a series of robust tests as part of a jointly developed factory acceptance test program and initial results confirm the Alevo GridBank capabilities, including its high power, among other attributes.

{"body": " The Conversation:Germanys Plan for 100% Electric Cars May Actually Increase Carbon Emissions Germany has ambitious plans for both electric cars and renewable energy. But it cant deliver both. As things stand, Germanys well-meaning but contradictory ambitions would actually boost emissions by an amount comparable with the present-day emissions of the entire country of Uruguay or the state of Montana. In an analysis published in Nature, my colleague Harry Hoster and I have looked at how Germanys electricity and transport policies are intertwined. They each serve the noble goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, when combined, they might actually lead to increased emissions. We investigated what it would take for Germany to keep to its announcements and fully electrify its road transportation -- and what that would mean for emissions. Our research shows that you cant simply erase fossil fuels from both energy and transport in one go, as Germany may be about to find out. The Sacramento Bee: Wrong Statements by Lawmaker on Solar Energy Stir Backlash The third-ranking Republican in the Indiana Senate wrongly said that a financial incentive for installing solar panels would likely disappear unless lawmakers supported his bill to revamp the benefit. At least one lawmaker said that inaccurate testimony by Sen. Brandt Hershman during a recent Statehouse hearing led him to back the proposal. The bill would sharply curtail the benefit that homeowners, churches, businesses and schools now reap by harnessing the sun's energy. Hershman, of Lafayette, painted a dire picture when he promoted the bill. He inaccurately stated that without changes included in his measure, everyone who currently benefits from a state \"net metering\" program would be kicked off once a cap was met. BBC:Most Wood Energy Schemes Are a 'Disaster' for Climate Change Using wood pellets to generate low-carbon electricity is a flawed policy that is speeding up, not slowing down, climate warming. That's according to a new study which says wood is not carbon-neutral and emissions from pellets are higher than coal. Subsidies for biomass should be immediately reviewed, the author says. But the industry rejected the report, saying that wood energy cuts carbon significantly compared to fossil fuels. The Guardian: How Drones Are Helping Design the Solar Power Plants of the Future At the edge of a plot of muddy farmland, a few miles down the road from the University of California at Davis, an engineer takes a few quick steps across crop rows and lets go of a three-foot drone. Within seconds, the device -- which weighs less than 2 lbs. and carries a powerful camera -- ascends hundreds of feet into the cold, clear, blue sky and begins to snap detailed photos of the ground far below, including a long row of large solar panels mounted on steel poles. This flight is just a test, demonstrated by Kingsley Chen, the drone fleet coordinator for SunPower at the solar companys research and development center, which is under construction and about a two-hour drive northeast of the San Francisco Bay Area. The drone will enable SunPower to survey a wide region and help design a solar power farm that can fit more solar panels on a piece of land, more quickly and for lower costs than it previously could.

{"body": " Electric Light & Power: SPP Sets North American Record for Wind Power Southwest Power Pool set a wind power penetration record of 52.1 percent at 4:30 a.m., Feb. 12, becoming the first regional transmission organization (RTO) in North America to serve more than 50 percent of its load at a given time with wind energy. The milestone beats a previous North American RTO record of 49.2 percent that SPP set on April 24, 2016. Wind penetration is a measure of the amount of total load served by wind at a given time. As recently as the early 2000s, SPPs generating fleet included less than 400 MW of wind, and for years, wind was reported in the Other category in SPPs fuel mix data. Wind is now the third most-prevalent fuel source in the SPP region. It made up approximately 15 percent of the organizations generating capacity in 2016, behind only natural gas and coal. Installed wind-generation capacity increased in 2016 alone by more than 30 percent -- up 4,000 MW from 12 GW to more than 16 GW. E&E News Climatewire: DOE Faces Uncertain Role in National Security Michael Flynn's resignation as national security adviser is making headlines this week, but analysts say a less high-profile development on the president's National Security Council could make waves down the road. In a break from the prior administration, the Energy secretary is no longer a member of the National Security Council's senior management, known as the Principals Committee. It's a role that had been given to the Energy secretary because of the momentous responsibility that person has for overseeing the nation's nuclear weapons. Some experts say the absence of the secretary or another agency leader with nuclear weapons expertise who can inform White House discussions would be a mistake. The Hill: Trump Signs Bill Undoing Obama Coal Mining Rule President Trump on Thursday signed legislation ending a key Obama administration coal mining rule. The bill quashes the Office of Surface Mining's Stream Protection Rule, a regulation to protect waterways from coal mining waste that officials finalized in December. The legislation is the second Trump has signed into law ending an Obama-era environmental regulation. On Tuesday, he signed a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution undoing a financial disclosure requirement for energy companies. Both the mining and financial disclosure bills are the tip of a GOP push to undo a slate of regulations instituted in the closing days of the Obama administration. The House has passed several CRA resolutions, and the Senate has so far sent three of them to President Trump for his signature. China Daily: Sinopec to Harvest More Heat From Earth With its ambitious 5-year plan for geothermal, China aims to add 530 MW in geothermal power generation capacity and expand geothermal heating dramatically to clean up its air. By 2020, the country is aiming for a geothermal power installed capacity of 530 MW and a geothermal heating area of 1.6 billion square meters, according to the country's energy planner. Despite some geothermal projects being expensive to develop, projects in locations with good resources are still modestly profitable.

Reuters: Toyota to Recall All 2,800 Mirai Fuel Cell Cars on The Road Toyota Motor Corp. said on Wednesday it was recalling all of the roughly 2,800 zero-emission Mirai cars on the road due to problems with the output voltage generated by their fuel cell system. Toyota said that under unique driving conditions, such as if the accelerator pedal is depressed to the wide open throttle position after driving on a long descent while using cruise control, there was a possibility the output voltage generated by the fuel cell boost converter could exceed the maximum voltage. To date, Toyota has sold about 2,840 Mirai cars in Japan, the United States and some markets in Europe, as well as the United Arab Emirates.

{"body": " Last week, Californias quest for a clean grid revolution culminated in the introduction of a bill mandating 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. Senator Kevin de Len, a longtime environmental leader in the state senate, wrote the measure, which comes on the heels of last years major greenhouse gas reduction bill. Massachusetts legislators introduced the same goal with a deadline of 2035. Momentum behind such efforts has grown stronger in defiance of President Donald Trumps antediluvian approach to climate science. But it's too early to assess the chances of these passing. It's easier to prognosticate on the effects of passing such a goal. And there's a lot of evidence that 100 percent renewable energy is not the optimal way to decarbonize the grid. Opponents of renewable energy incentives often use the argument that government shouldn't pick winners and losers. There's a big difference between giving fledgling, socially beneficial technologies a boost so they can compete effectively in a calcified marketplace, and using the power of government to favor one set of mature companies over another in providing a similar service. The legal requirement to source 100 percent renewable energy looks more like the latter. But let's say climate change requires massive government investment in clean technologies. In that case, the question shifts to one of efficacy: Since climate change justifies extraordinary measures, what is the most effective extraordinary measure to fight it? Thats where 100 percent renewables plans fall short, for both structural and practical reasons. The stated goal is to decarbonize the electric grid. Converting all electrical generation to some combination of wind, hydro and solar is one way to achieve this goal. The proposals at hand would make that particular method the endpoint. At best, this is indirect policy: Instead of saying figure out the best way to decarbonize the grid, it says, figure out how to deploy a prescribed set of energy resources which should lead to the decarbonization of the grid. At worst, its picking one path to the exclusion of other, potentially better, paths. Here's how Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems researcher at MIT, framed this problem: Why would we want to constrain ourselves to a narrow set of options to confront climate change and air pollution and other energy sector challenges when those challenges are already quite difficult? This only makes sense if it's possible to prove that some combination of wind, hydro and solar is the most practical route to a zero-carbon grid, accounting for speed, cost and probability of success. Not only should it beat every option currently available, but any future possibilities based on technological progress in the next several decades. Arguably the most prominent planners of the 100 percent renewable approach are Mark Jacobson of Stanford University and Mark Delucchi of UC-Berkeley, and they end up arguing that the ramp-up of renewable production to power the whole country is possible given our nation's previous success withWorld War II-era societal mobilization. That's an inspiring precedent, but not one you'd like to see guiding a feasibility study. We dont know that a 100 percent renewable approach is the fastest, cheapest or easiest way to decarbonize the grid. We do know that it will be expensive and hard enough that its own advocates compare it to the most gargantuan collective effort in the nations history. Setting aside the case for keeping options open, the operational realities of a completely renewables-powered grid create challenges that could be avoided with other zero-carbon configurations. Solar and wind alone cannot be relied upon for constant service. This requires some combination of: 1) overbuilding capacity over a geographically dispersed region; 2) using a whole lot of storage; and 3) dramatically improving regional import and export of electricity. If solar and wind form the baseload, you have to prepare for the scenario when the sun is mostly blocked and wind is weak. One way to do this is building enough extra capacity that with all the fleet operating at its trough of productivity, there is still enough to power the system. That requires building capacity well beyond the reserves required of thermal plants, which produce a much higher percentage of their potential output. This multiplies the cost of the build-out, which is compounded by the diminishing returns of additional renewable capacity. With so much extra solar on the grid, grid operators have to deal with over-generation when the weather conditions are optimal. Solar and wind plants may have to curtail their output under such conditions. The more solar that goes onto the grid without a productive use, the more curtailment any additional solar facilities will face. Value declines due to curtailment because each unit of potential PV production no longer displaces one unit of fossil generation, states a study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on how to reach 50 percent PV penetration in California. As curtailment increases, the benefits of additional PV may drop to the point where additional installations are not worth the cost, creating an economic limit to deployment. Storage offers a hopeful way out of this conundrum, allowing renewables to act more like traditional power plants. California has almost single-handedly jump-started the advanced storage industry by setting a statewide mandate, but the state is still in the early stages of this rollout. That means utilities are still testing how storage works on the grid, and how it performs after several years of service -- both of which are crucial to planning a grid that is all renewables. Residential storage is even more nascent, with companies scrounging for customers and small-scale pilot programs. Residential storage could play a role in balancing the grid and shifting loads, but it needs to reach millions more customers to fulfill that role. Additionally, expanding Californias grid connections with its neighbors would smooth the renewable expansion by allowing more imports and exports at opportune times. This kind of interconnectivity of transmission lines takes a long time and requires coordination with several states -- and it's also quite controversial in the region. Even with optimal grid improvements, California would still need an estimated 15 gigawatts of additional storage just to reach 50 percent solar by 2030, according to an NRELstudy. Thats more than 11 times the amount of storage mandated currently in California, and 66 times the total megawatts deployed in the U.S. last year. This represents a massively expensive undertaking. A different studyfrom Jenkins and researchers at Argonne National Lab demonstrates how the need for storage goes down if the grid includes some sort of flexible baseload power in addition to intermittent renewables. More flexible nuclear power or natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) could fill this role, in places where substantial hydropower isnt available. Small modular nuclear reactors are still in a very early stage of regulatory review, and CCS has not achieved commercial success, so these are not certain options. A lot can happen in 28 years, though, and a zero-carbon mandate for the California market would be a powerful driver for development of such technologies. Again, thats if Californias goal is to achieve a zero-carbon grid -- rather than just solely boost renewables. In a previous interview, Jenkins described what proposals like the one in California will accomplish:Its not saying this is the best pathway forward in terms of any metric, particularly in terms of cost. They say, How much can we push renewables and only renewables? And what will be necessary to try to decarbonize with that pathway alone? Choosing that pathway alone will mean all kinds of other decarbonization pathways get shut out.

{"body": " Anticipation for Elon Musk'sinvestor note and analyst Q&A was high last week. For the first time since the SolarCity acquisition, Tesla executives discussed 2016 results and production plans for the coming years. Here are some takeaways. EV pioneer Tesla's fate depends on the production ramp-up of its $35,000 \"mainstream\" Model 3. Musk said that his firm is \"on track for initial production\" in July, followed by \"volume production by September.\" At some point in Q4, Tesla says it will be able to make 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, followed by 10,000 Model 3 cars per week in 2018. These are aggressive plans -- the firm has not yet started road-testing the production model. As previously reported, Tesla started making early prototypes of Model 3 cars just this month, as part of the process of testing the design and manufacturing. Guidance for 2017 was held to H1 deliveries (47,000-50,000 units), capex and auto margins, with no forecast of H2 margins, opexor solar targets. \"I currently think that we should build...500,000 vehicles next year and 1 million vehicles by 2020. That's 500,000 vehicles in total, Model S, Model 3, and Model X combined next year,\" said Musk. Musk said Tesla has enough capital to reach the market with the Model 3, but its cash situation would be close to the edge.\" To reduce the companys risk, it probably makes sense to raise more capital.\" UBS writes, \"Cash burn was bad and is getting worse.\" According to UBS, even with a $155 per kilowatt-hour battery pack cost in 2025, \"the Model 3 will still cost about $7,000 more to build than an equivalent ICE vehicle.\" Tesla announced the resignation of CFO Jason Wheeler and the hiring of Deepak Ahuja (who served as Tesla's CFO from 2008 until 2015), for the position. Ahuja will earn a base salary of $500,000 and a $15 million equity grant. Tesla received notice from Wheeler on February 21, a day before Q4 earnings were issued. Tesla installed 201 megawatts of solar versus a guidance of 250 megawatts. The firm is now looking to \"prioritize cash preservation over growth of megawatts deployed\" ahead of the solar roof tile product launch later this year. Tesla aims \"to reduce customer acquisition costs by cutting advertising spending, selling solar products in Tesla stores, and shifting from leasing to selling solar energy systems. \"Tesla has a very strong global brand. We've got a great retail footprint. So, we've got the pieces in place to really drive customer acquisition cost down.\" 28 percent of solar capacity deployed during Q4 was sold rather than leased, up from 13 percent sold in Q3, and less than 4 percent in Q4 2015. Battery cell production started at the Gigafactory and Tesla sold 98 megawatt-hours of storage products during the fourth quarter, the better part installed at Aliso Canyon. Other grid-scale projects include the Mira Loma substation, a 20-megawatt/80-megawatt-hour energy storage system for SCE, and a solar power and battery storage-enabled microgrid in American Samoa. If one makes a WAG of average pricing ranging from $225 per kilowatt-hour to $450 per kilowatt-hour, then large-scale energy storage revenue for the quarter at Tesla was $22 million to $44 million. All Tesla vehicles in production have the hardware necessary for full self-driving, according to the firm. Musk acknowledged \"some challenges in the transition from Mobileye to Tesla software.\" \"We could have released Tesla Vision and including 'high speed,' probably three months ago -- I was driving at 'high speed' personally three months ago, but I think we want to just have an exhaustive testing process, vetting process before enabling that throughout the fleet. So, we've been edging our way up there gradually. Now, longitudinal control, the Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is at 80 miles an hour. And Autosteer is at 50 miles an hour, and I think we should be able to get, unless testing shows something different, we should be able to get them both to around the maybe 85 miles an hour next month.\" If vehicles with autopilot and self-driving features are probably more safe than other cars on a per-mile-driven basis, shouldn't insurance premiums reflect that? In fact, Tesla is already offering its own insurance product. The CFO said, \"On Asia in particular, where we started this, now the majority of Tesla cars are sold with an insurance product that is customized to Tesla. It takes into account not only this autopilot safety features, but also the maintenance cost of the car. So, it's our vision in the future that we'll be able to offer a single price for the car, maintenance, and insurance, in a really compelling offering for the consumer.\" Musk was discussing manufacturing: \"Calculating the area under the curve is tricky when you're in an exponential. And it always starts out tiny and then spools up. Well, it spools up exponentially, but generally people have trouble wrapping their minds around an exponential, the natural tendency is to extrapolate on the straight line. And so, that's why it was important to emphasize that this is -- the spool up is an exponential. It kind of does get into a linear zone, and then it goes into a logarithm.\" \"We're going to continue to drive efficiencies in G&A. We have to do that. In part, because we can't fit people in the building. It may seems like a silly concern, but it's really quite difficult. We have a real volumetric problem. It's a good constraint to have. So, parking is like one of my biggest nightmares. Where do we park everyone? You can't fit everyone. So we have to make our opex better because there's nowhere for people to go.\" *** Thanks to SA for the transcript.

{"body": " Tesla CEO Elon Musk told shareholders on Wednesday afternoon that the company is on track to start initial production of the Model 3 in July, followed by larger volume manufacturing in September.  At some point in the fourth quarter of this year, Tesla says it will be able to make 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, followed by 10,000 Model 3 cars per week in 2018.  The timing of the Model 3 is a big deal to Tesla. Its the companys first \"mainstream\" car, with a price tag of $35,000. Tesla has invested heavily in the design process and making a bigger battery for the car.  Predicting exactly when Tesla will be able to move from low-volume production into much higher-volume production for its vehicles has been notoriously hard. Its Model X car was plagued by engineering and manufacturing issues in its early versions, slowing down production for months. Tesla didnt give more detailed guidance for the second half of the year. According to the company's shareholder letter, even a couple [of] week[s] shift in timing could have a meaningful impact on total deliveries and installs. Instead, Tesla says it will deliver 47,000 to 50,000 Model S and X cars in the first half of 2017. During the earnings call, Musk and Tesla CTO JB Straubel said that manufacturing the Model 3 will be different undertaking from previous models. Weve learned a lot of lessons from the difficult Model X launch, said Straubel, noting that the company has a simpler design for the Model 3 and plans to work on many Model 3 production lines from the start of the manufacturing process.  While painful, the Model X launch was a helpful experience when it comes to making Model 3, said Straubel. Musk reiterated how hard it is to predict a ramp-up of production when it comes to making cars. The rate of production is as fast as the slowest component in the supply chain of the vehicle, said Musk, explaining there are several thousand unique items used in each car. Its like schedule whack-a-mole, said Musk.  As previously reported, Tesla started making early prototypes of Model 3 cars this month, as part of the process of testing the design and manufacturing. The company reports that preliminary crash test results \"have been positive, for the Model 3 prototypes. Right now, Tesla is in the process of installing new manufacturing equipment for the Model 3 in its Fremont, California factory, as well as in its massive battery factory outside of Reno, Nevada. The Gigafactory is already making the larger format batteries -- called the 2170s -- that will be used in the Model 3. Those batteries are also being used in Teslas grid and home batteries.  Teslas major focus this year is to ensure that the design and production of the Model 3 is such that it can eventually make a profit from a $35,000 car. The very first Model 3 cars that will come off the line -- intended for employees and investors -- will cost far more to make than the $35,000 price tag.  Musk said on the call that the margins of the early Model 3 cars will be horrible, and that no company on the planet would be able to get around that issue.  General Motors could reportedly lose $9,000 per every $36,000 electric Bolt sold. It will be a common problem for automakers as they launch lower-cost electric cars while battery costs remain comparatively high. But Tesla appears to be doing everything in its power to get the Model 3 costs down as much as possible. Making its batteries at scale in conjunction with Panasonic at the Gigafactory is one way. Tesla recently said it will cut battery costs by 35 percent through the Gigafactory.  The Model 3 also wont have many of the bells and whistles of the Model S and Model X, such as the self-presenting door handles and swooping gull-wing doors. The Model 3 will also have one screen, instead of the two screens and two computers in the higher-end cars.  Tesla is planning on buying enough parts to make 2,000 Model 3s in July and 4,000 Model 3s in August, said Musk on the call. But those are just parts orders, he said. The number of cars shipped could be different. Musk also said that while Tesla has enough capital raised to get the Model 3 to market, it would be close to the edge in terms of how much money its spending. To reduce the companys risk, it probably makes sense to raise more capital, said Musk.

{"body": " A power-sharing coalition between the pro-U.K. Democratic Unionist Party and the pro-Irish Sinn Fin in Northern Ireland has broken down over a badly botched renewables subsidy scheme that could cost the region up to 1 billion ($1.25 billion). The two parties are part of the Northern Ireland Assembly, which was set up to help end decades of violent struggle in the region by allowing representatives of the Protestant and Catholic communities to govern together. Its First Minister, head of Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Arlene Foster, has refused to step down over accusations she was responsible for fatal flaws in Northern Irelands Renewable Heat Incentive scheme. As a result, Deputy First Minister and Sinn Fin member Martin McGuinness has resigned, triggering an election that will take place on March 2 this year. Set up in November 2012, the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was an attempt by Northern Ireland to help to increase consumption of heat from renewable sources. The overall goal was to achieve 4 percent of heat coming from renewables by 2015, and 10 percent by 2020. One of its main goals was to subsidize the purchase and running of wooden pellet biomass boilers for farms and other businesses. Successful applicants could look forward to economic assistance for 20 years. Unlike a similar scheme set up in the rest of the U.K., there was no cap on the amount of subsidy for burning biomass. The more you burned, the more you earned -- a grave program-design misjudgment that ended up having major ramifications later. As a spokesperson for the U.K.s Renewable Energy Association explained: The RHI offers what is essentially a feed-in tariff to participants. The equivalent scheme in the rest of the U.K. has caps, plus degression, a price-control measure which lets the subsidy rate be reduced in response to demand and also to quickly close the scheme, if need be. None of these apply in the case of the Northern Ireland RHI. Despite the scale of state generosity, initial interest in the RHI fell flat. Until early 2015, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), which held ultimate responsibility for the scheme, under-spent its 25 million ($31 million) budget by 15 million ($19 million). The minister in charge of the DETI at the time was Arlene Foster. Although there was scant public interest in RHI, alarm bells were already ringing in the corridors of power. Or rather, they should have been. In 2013 a whistleblower contacted DETI Minister Foster detailing misgivings about the scheme. The anonymous individual sent a reminder email on May 12 that year. The DETI subsequently acted -- by extending the RHI into the domestic sector. Whats more, an opportunity for the Department of Finance to review the scheme in January 2015 did not take place due to a \"combination of staff changes and an administrative oversight,\" according to the department. In the meantime, the number of RHI applications skyrocketed -- 98 percent of which were approved, seemingly with little or no consideration from the authorities. As a result, factories and farms with no previous need for heating were installing boilers and hoping for handouts of up to 1 million ($1.25 million) per installation over the course of 20 years. It was a combination of these claims and the enormous in applications that led to an investigation in February of last year -- and the official closing of the RHI. A probe into applications found that some were entirely fraudulent. However, the majority were legitimate and are likely to be honored. As a result, the whole fiasco could cost Northern Ireland 1 billion ($1.25 billion). Despite the fact that she headed the DETI at the time, First Minister Foster has refused to resign. Staff also attempted to remove her name from documents relating to the RHI, something she insisted she did not order. Her refusal to step down was the final straw for Sinn Fin, and Assembly Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness stepped down himself. Since he held joint office with Foster, his departure meant that by law a general election must be called. The political chaos could extend far and wide. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May contacted both Foster and McGuinness to urge them to resolve the crisis, fearing that a new election, only seven months after the last one, could further undermine the entire countrys Brexit strategy. Her pleas fell flat, and Northern Ireland goes to the polls in less than six weeks. Frank Aaskov, policy analyst at the U.K. Renewable Heat Association, said that whatever the political fallout of the \"cash for ash\" affair, it will have minimal effect on renewables. The Renewable Heat Incentive that covers Great Britain, which includes England, Wales and Scotland, is administered out of London and is completely distinct from the scheme in Northern Ireland, he said. The scheme in Great Britain has clear regulations in place, including caps and mechanisms that reduce the tariffs as the technology improves, that prevent the such a significant overspend from occurring. The Great Britain RHI is a pillar of the U.K.s energy decarbonization strategy and has been the primary scheme that has supported the growth of renewable heat systems such as biomass boilers, biogas plants, solar thermal systems and heat pumps. It is an important mechanism that supports the governments movement toward meeting the 2020 renewable energy targets, in addition to the U.K.s carbon budgets in the 2020s and 2030s,\" said Aaskov. Meanwhile, the political scandal continues to rumble on, with Finance Minister Mirtn  Muilleoirof Sinn Fin calling for a public inquiry and members of the Northern Ireland Assembly revealing that their relatives had taken full advantage of the RHI.", "theme": "Biofuels", "title": "Flawed Renewables Subsidy Program Leads to Political Turmoil in Northern Ireland", "comments": "2", "tags": ["political scandal", "subsidies", "wood pellets"]}
{"body": " Enbala has just cemented its partnership with ABB with a new funding round. On Thursday, the Vancouver, Canada-based startup announced $12 million in Series B venture financing, led by ABB Technology Ventures, the venture arm of the Swiss grid giant. The funding comes on the heels of ABB announcing last month that it has picked Enbalas technology to build out its distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) -- an extension of its grid software to behind-the-meter resources. That can include solar PV, on-site generators, batteries and other generation assets, as well as pumps, chillers, fans, lights, and other energy-consuming devices that can be turned on and off in response to on-site or grid-side needs. DERMS technology is a hot commodity among forward-looking utilities, particularly those in regions with lots of customer-sited rooftop PV. Most are looking to layer it atop their advanced distribution management software (ADMS), which has put grid giants like ABB, SiemensandGeneral Electric under pressure to deliver this capability, Enbala CEO Bud Vos said in a Wednesday interview. The new funding will help speed several pilot projects that ABB and Enbala are working on together that should be up and running this year, Vos said, though he wouldnt provide specific details. There are a lot of utilities buying ADMS products, and all are looking for the extension into the DERMS world. This opens up the ability to bring Enbala into those ADMS deals.\" Enbala got its start aggregating industrial loads like pumps and refrigerators to play into frequency regulation marketsfor mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM, Ontario, Canadas IESO and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In the past several years its adapted its technology platform for use by energy services providers and utilities, with behind-the-scenes work with partners like Hawaiian Electric and Southern California Edison. Another new investor in Thursdays round was National Grid, the U.K.-based investor-owned utility that operates big utilities in the U.S. Northeast. Theyve been building a distributed energy business, he said, citing National Grids recent investment in Sunrun, and they see our optimization and orchestration platform as being critical to managing those resources, he said. While he wouldnt say what the two companies were working on together, he did mention going out and building massive projects that are very strategic for the grid, with projects expected to be announced in 2017. The new funding brings Enbalas total venture capital raised to date to about $42 million. This fuels the company for growth [and] R&D and gives us a really long runway, Vos said. Previous investors, including GE Ventures, Chrysalix Venture Capital and Obvious Ventures, also participated in the round. Enbala has a lot of competition on the DERMS front, both from grid giants developing their own platforms, to startups likeAdvanced Microgrid Solutions,Blue Pillar,AutoGrid,Opus One,Power Analytics,Spirae,Smarter Grid Solutions, and the recentlyacquired Viridity Energy. So far, the actual market for managing distributed energy resources is rather small, but GTM Research projects the North American DERMS software market will more than double by 2018 to $110 million, driven by grid operators need for visibility and control of distributed generation and demand response.", "theme": "Grid Optimization", "title": "Enbala Raises $12M Investment Led by Grid Software Partner ABB", "comments": "1", "tags": ["abb", "autogrid", "blue pillar", "chrysalix", "demand response", "derms", "distributed energy", "distribution management system", "electric vehicles", "enbala", "energy storage", "ge ventures", "general electric", "grid", "investment"]}

Although some White House CEQ staffers will remain in adjoining townhouses, the shift means the council will lose its main conference room.

Seeking Alpha:Another Quarter, Another Executive Departure For Tesla Buried among the fanfare of a profitless fourth quarter from Tesla is the most important announcement, one not made in the annual update letter but rather as a one sentence send-off in the conference call: Jason Wheeler, Tesla's CFO, is leaving to pursue a \"public policy\" position. Sound familiar? It should, considering that seven executives left the company last year. What makes the departure even more astonishing is that Wheeler only spent 15 months at the company, his addition being announced in November of 2015. Perhaps more concerning, however, is his replacement: Deepak Ahuja, i.e., the CFO Wheeler was brought on to replace in the first place. There is little debate possible about how great of a step-down this is: Ahuja was hired away from a board directorship at FireEye, and before his previous stint at Tesla was a Product Development Controller at Ford. This contrasts starkly with the success that Wheeler found at Google, where he spent 13 years as VP of finance. The Economist: Wind and Solar Power Are Disrupting Electricity Systems Almost 150 years after photovoltaic cells and wind turbines were invented, they still generate only 7% of the worlds electricity. Yet something remarkable is happening. From being peripheral to the energy system just over a decade ago, they are now growing faster than any other energy source, and their falling costs are making them competitive with fossil fuels. BP, an oil firm, expects renewables to account for half of the growth in global energy supply over the next 20 years. It is no longer far-fetched to think that the world is entering an era of clean, unlimited and cheap power. About time, too. There is a $20 trillion hitch, though. To get from here to there requires huge amounts of investment over the next few decades, to replace old smog-belching power plants and to upgrade the pylons and wires that bring electricity to consumers. Normally investors like putting their money into electricity because it offers reliable returns. Yet green energy has a dirty secret. The more it is deployed, the more it lowers the price of power from any source. That makes it hard to manage the transition to a carbon-free future, during which many generating technologies, clean and dirty, need to remain profitable if the lights are to stay on. Unless the market is fixed, subsidies to the industry will only grow.

{"body": " As an \"an independent growth platform\" owned 60 percent by Toshiba, smart meter and grid networking player Landis+Gyr doesnt have to report its financials in the same detail as do its public rivals like Itron and Silver Spring Networks. But with Toshiba facing a financial crisis tied to cost overruns at its U.S. nuclear business -- and Landis+Gyr facing a writedown in value after two years of disappointingly slow growth -- the Swiss-based conglomerate decided to unveil some financial details to show its still a major player in the advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) field. The company, unaffected by Toshibas challenges,\" is expecting $1.64 billion in revenues for the fiscal year ending in March, Landis+Gyr wrote in a Wednesday announcement. That represents nearly 5 percent growth from $1.57 billion in 2015, and will come with year-on-year growth in operating profit and about $100 million in cash flow, it reported. While the company didnt release figures on its profit, CEO Andreas Umbach said in a statement that the company is a profitable, fully independent operation, with its own governance body, audit and risk committee and separate financial statements from Toshiba. It's held that status since it was acquired by the Japanese industrial, electronics and energy giant in 2011. Those revenues arent as high as Itrons $1.9 billion in 2015, but theyre close. And they dwarf those of competitor Silver Spring Networks, which just reported $311 million in 2016 revenues. Of course, Silver Spring doesnt build its own meters, which reduces its revenues (but also its costs per meter deployed). In some cases, Silver Springs network interface cards are embedded in Landis+Gyr meters. Competing meter makers include Germanys Elster, which was bought by Honeywell for $5 billion in 2015, and U.S.-based Sensus, which was bought by water treatment company Xylem for $1.7 billion last year.  Landis+Gyr has distinguished itself over the past few years by winning a majority of the mega-contracts for smart meters, including 27 million meters with Tokyo Electric Power and 16 million meters for British Gas. This kind of volume shows up in its projected backlog of $2.4 billion for the fiscal year -- more than Silver Springs backlog of $1.165 billion for 2016, and Itrons backlog of $1.5 billion as of the third quarter of 2016. Landis+Gyr has also provided Toshiba about $500 million to pay down debt added to the balance sheet as a part of the acquisition from private equity firm Bayard Group. Thats led to a solid balance sheet, the company reported, with an equity ratio of 65 percent at the end of last year, and net debt below $200 million, equivalent to around one years EBITDA level.\"  Landis+Gyrs release comes as Toshiba, which bought a 60-pecent stake in the company for $2.3 billion, is reportedly considering a writedown of the companys goodwill value. According to Reuters, Landis+Gyrs goodwill value was 143.2 billion yen ($1.3 billion) at the end of September, and Toshiba is considering a further writedown. Toshiba's latest earnings report, released in November, notes that Landis+Gyr saw lower sales and lower operating income for the first six months of 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The recent history of Landis+Gyr, founded in 1896 in Switzerland, has been complicated since the company entered the electronic meter business in the 1980s. It was owned by KKR and Siemens in the '90s, and sold to Australias Bayard Capital in 2004, where it spent $1.2 billion to acquire a series of networking providers, including Cellnet and Hunt, which make up a good share of its legacy business in cellular metering. Over the past decade and a half, it has moved into mesh networking along with Itron, Silver Spring, Elster and others, and invested in the software to support smart meters, grid sensors and other IT-enabled devices. It also went on a shopping spree with Toshibas capital, buying meter data management software vendor Ecologic Analytics in 2012, demand response technology provider Consert in 2013, distribution grid modeling software vendor GRIDiant, and grid sensor maker PowerSense in 2014. Umbach noted that Landis+Gyr continues to invest in research and development, with self-funded R&D investments expected to reach $160 million this year. It also keeps its accounting separate from Toshiba -- a fact it highlighted in July 2015, after Toshiba underwent an accounting scandal related to its overstatement of profits by nearly $2 billion.", "theme": "Networking/AMI", "title": "Landis+Gyr Lays Out Its Financial Health as Parent Company Toshiba Faces Crisis", "comments": "0", "tags": ["ami", "bayard capital", "cellnet", "elster", "finance", "honeywell", "hunt", "itron", "landis+gyr", "revenue", "sensus", "silver spring networks", "smart grid", "smart meter", "toshiba"]}

{"body": " AES operates 35,000 megawatts of power plants globally worth $37 billion. Only 200 megawatts of the portfolio is solar. That's about to change. This morning, AES unveiled plans to acquire sPower, the 10th-largest solar developer in the U.S., for $853 million in cash. AES will buy sPower from the private equity firm Fir Tree Partners. Once completed, the acquisition will give AES an additional 1,274 megawatts of utility-scale solar power plants, a portfolio of 10,000 megawatts of projects in various stages, and a world class solar development team. AES will take on sPower's operations and a 50 percent equity stake in all projects. The Alberta Investment Management Corporation will take on the other 50 percent stake in projects. It's a decisive move into utility-scale solar for AES, which has dabbled in the market by acquiring a handful of individual projects. The independent power provider also acquired C&I developer Main Street Power in 2015, rebranding the company AES Distributed Energy. It has so far failed to become a strong player in the distributed solar market. AES now turns to utility-scale solar, a sector that grew 145 percent in 2016, according the latest tally from GTM Research. \"We have talked a lot about solar in the last year,\" said Amy Ackerman, manager of AES investor relations. \"As we expand gas, storage and renewables, we'd like to add solar to our existing platform.\" \"Platformization\" has become an increasingly common way to describe some of the big acquisitions in utility-scale and commercial solar. More conglomerates are eyeing gigawatt-scale portfolios as a way to become top developers and asset owners overnight, rather than acquire assets on a project-by-project basis. In just the last six months, JP Morgan acquired Sonnedix, Cypress Creek Renewables bought FLS Energy, NRG scooped up 1,500 megawatts of SunEdison projects, and Mitsui acquired SunEdison's commercial development team in order to create \"a platform for providing a range of services\" to C&I customers. AES' acquisition of sPower is the biggest since SunEdison bought First Wind for $2.4 billion. M&A activity may just be getting started in utility-scale development. After the rush to get projects completed in 2016 before tax credits expired, current project pipelines are depleted. GTM Research expects utility-scale projects to drop from 10.6 gigawatts in 2016 down to 8.7 gigawatts in 2017. Completed projects could fall to 6.3 gigawatts in 2018, before rising year-over-year through 2022. Buyers are looking for companies with a long queue of projects lined up over the next few years. \"This acquisition is probably the first of a few to come,\" said Colin Smith, a solar analyst with GTM Research. \"It's a seller's market. Everyone wants to refill the pipeline.\" AES now gets access to one of the steadiest pipelines in the U.S. market. \"They will consistently bring in projects year over year with sPower,\" said Smith.  Source: GTM ResearchU.S. Downstream Utility-Scale Solar Service AES is a Fortune 200 company that can command a lower cost of capital.

{"body": " It's a time of great uncertaintyforleading residential solar installers. Butthere are positive signs with energy companies serving a different part of the residential sector: PACE. Renew Financial, one of the largest purveyors of property-assessed clean energy (PACE) financing, has been in the business for nine years, since founder and CEO Cisco DeVries pioneered the mechanism at the Berkeley city government. PACE lets homeowners buy higher-end energy efficiency and solar improvements with no money down, by distributing the cost across property tax payments over many years. It's taken some time for the approach to spread. For some customers, perhaps, it's hard to get them excited about property tax assessments. And since these assessments happen locally, PACE financiers spent a lot time on policy formation at the city and state level to make this business viable. That work culminated in a billion-dollar payoff. \"We've done a billion overall and we're going to try to do that again this year,\" said DeVries, referring to the dollar value of the company's financing deals. \"That's what we're on pace to do. I have hundreds of millions of dollars of capacity that I'm already spending.\" After all those years building up the model, it's reached a point where Renew could eclipse nine years of business in 2017 alone. Other leading PACE providers like Renovate America and Ygreneare accelerating, too. Americans spend $150 billion annually on home energy improvements, DeVries said, so there's a massive potential market for the PACE companies to chase. \"Most of this is still an education, engagement and market transformation phase, so there's a long way to go before our growth comes at the expense of somebody else,\" he said. The Renew business model can scale in part because its fixed costs are low. The company spends \"hardly any\" money on customer acquisition, opting instead for a channel-driven approach. In California, the largest PACE market, Renew has vetted and partnered with 2,500 contractors. They serve as the front line for customer engagement, because they're the ones getting calls when a furnace goes out or a roof starts to leak. The partnership with Renew allows the contractors to pitch higher-efficiency products that might be out of range otherwise -- the PACE model unlocks a long-term financing plan with a low cost of capital. \"It's not just providing the financing, which is critical; it is finding people at the moment when they're going to have to make an energy improvement anyway,\" DeVries said. \"If they've already done it, they're not going to touch their furnace again for 30 years. That improvement is going to sit there and it's going to do a bad job for them, costing them money and wasting energy for 30 years.\" When the timing is right and the needs of the customer match the service PACE provides, everybody gets something. The contractor can make more money and get paid quickly and in full by Renew; the customer gets a nicer home improvement that saves more money in the long term; Renew makes money; and the process facilitates a reduction in carbon emissions. As this financing option grows in popularity, it's not hard to imagine less diligent actors chasing those dollars. Without the proper safeguards, an overly zealous PACE purchase could burden a homeowner's property taxes beyond what they can pay off, leading down a dark financial path. So far, DeVries noted, nobody in the U.S. has gone into foreclosure due to PACE. State Sen. Nancy Skinner has introduced legislation in Sacramento to impose a minimum standard for consumer protection in PACE, a bill the company supports. It's in the industry's interest to keep that foreclosure count at zero. The success of PACE financiers feeds directly into the success of the solar installers they work with (about 20 percent of Renew's business is solar PV installation). This particularly helps the \"long tail\" installers, those local companies that don't have the same kind of financial clout as their nationwide brethren. For those major installers, there may be lessons here about how to strategically avoid paying lots of money to acquire customers, and instead leverage local partners to find buyers at the moment they're most primed for a big energy purchase.", "theme": "ESCOs & Financing Efficiency", "title": "PACE Lender Renew Financial Expects to Close $1 Billion in Deals in 2017, Outpacing Last Nine Years", "comments": "6", "tags": ["california", "energy efficiency", "energy efficiency financing", "long tail", "pace", "renew financial", "residential solar"]}

{"body": " Australian advanced lead-acid battery maker Ecoult says this months expansion into India is the first step in creating a global manufacturing network. Chief executive John Wood told GTM he expects his Sydney-based company to sign licensing deals with manufacturers in most major energy storage markets by 2019. At the same time, the company is hoping to significantly improve performance and halve the cost of deploying its products for an unspecified number of applications, Wood said. Im looking to be a cost leader, he commented. Ecoult is stepping up its international ambitions on the back of five years of field experience with its UltraBattery technology, which is billed as a hybrid between a lead-acid battery and a supercapacitor. Currently, most of the companys installed base, which equates to around 12 megawatts and 12 megawatt-hours, is evenly distributed between many kilowatt-scale commercial and industrial installations in Australia and fewer, larger plants in the U.S., Wood said. One example of the latter is a 3-megawatt storage system that has been providing regulation services on the PJM Interconnection grid since 2012. Ecoult has also provided a 250-kilowatt, 1 megawatt-hour UltraBattery Energy Resource system for solar smoothing at PNMs Prosperity PV plant in New Mexico. The installation has been running since 2013. Ecoult debuted in the European market last year with a Dublin, Ireland-based project carried out in association with German power converter maker Freqcon for an Irish smart grid testbed. Until recently, Wood said Ecoult was cautious about promoting its products too heavily, pending the availability of long-term performance data from the field. Experience gained over the last half-decade shows that even with the earliest UltraBattery products, which lack many of the refinements of newer models, weve still only replaced a small number of batteries, Wood said.  This experience gave Ecoults 38-person team the confidence to go big on global markets. Earlier this month, Australias top clean-energy funding body, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) committed a AUD $4.1 million (USD $3.2 million) recoupable funding package to help Ecoult deliver on both its local and global objectives, according to a press release. The funding followed the signing of a deal between Ecoult and Exide Industries, Indias largest battery manufacturer, to produce UltraBattery units for the Indian and South Asian markets. Wood said he expected to see the first UltraBattery units rolling out of Exides India plant within nine months. He also said Ecoult was looking to close similar deals elsewhere, likely starting with other developing markets where the UltraBatterys technical capabilities would allow it to compete with existing lead-acid chemistries. Ecoult claims the UltraBattery offers higher charge and discharge rates than traditional lead-acid batteries. It also claims better performance at partial state of charge, reduced sulfation, longer lifespan and an efficiency usually well above 90 percent, versus lead-acids 85 percent or so. In 2012, tests by Sandia National Laboratories revealed the UltraBattery could run for more than 20,000 cycles without significant loss of capacity. The technology, which was originally developed within Australias Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in 2007, is also non-combustible and, like other lead-acid batteries, fully recyclable. Pennsylvania-based East Penn, which owns the Deka brand and operates the worlds largest single-site lead-acid battery factory, bought Ecoult in 2010 and now makes UltraBattery units at its Lyon Station manufacturing facility. Three years after the purchase, ARENA pumped AUD $583,780 (USD $449,260) into Ecoult to help optimize the UltraBattery for off-grid applications through the development of a kilowatt-scale version dubbed the UltraFlex. The latest ARENA cash injection is notable for its focus on commercialization outside Australia, since the funding agency is usually known for supporting the development of projects on national soil. This gives us scope to build on Australia's rich history of invention by helping local companies develop world-leading renewable energy solutions, which when commercialized will be able to compete in export markets,\" saidthe agency's press team.", "theme": "Energy Storage", "title": "With Millions From Australia, Ecoult Takes Its Hybrid Superconductor and Lead-Acid Battery Global", "comments": "23", "tags": ["australian renewable renewable energy agency", "ecoult"]}
{"body": " Are supercapacitors going to spark the battery storage revolution? According to a survey of 600 energy industry executives and experts, the technology will play a central role in improving the performance of batteries connected to the grid. The survey was conducted by Lloyd's Register, a global technical consulting organization. Lloyd's is well respected. But some are calling its conclusions about supercapacitors into question. \"The storage technology that respondents believe will have the biggest impact is electrical technology such as supercapacitors, which will rapidly speed up charging times for large batteries,\" wrote the organizationin its report. While supercapacitors will indeed play a role in scaling storage, the idea that they can rapidly speed up charging times for large batteries is wrong, according to some analysts. The simple answer is 'no,' supercapacitors won't make chemical batteries charge faster,\" said Dr. Julia Attwood, an expert in emerging technologies at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Although supercapacitors are already being used to deliver very rapid charging to electric buses, Some batteries can charge very quickly, but that's a property of the cell and pack design. It's not because of the supercapacitors,\" she said. The confusion, said Attwood, may be due to a mixing of terminology. So, they might mean that energy storage systems made up of supercapacitors can charge very quickly, which is true.Occasionally I see energy storage technologies that aren't technically batteries referred to that way.\" Jason Knights, head of media relations for Lloyds Register, said the views from respondents confirmed the value of supercapacitors in many applications, and as a way of complementing battery charging and use. But Knights also highlighted that there are developments under way in terms of how supercapacitors can offer a better solution than batteries which is evident in the findings of the report and gives an alternative view from Dr. Attwood. He said the report signifies that supercapacitors will maximize battery cell life by maintaining slow and shallow charge/discharges. The supercapacitors in essence do all the hard work. The report also identifies the fact that supercapacitors have begun to take on some roles traditionally assigned to batteries. But there is still some way to go although respondents in the Technology Radar survey see this technology as a root for further development and testing. New advances in materials technology, such as the use of graphene and other compounds, may also increase capacity in the near future, which could make the supercapacitor a real option to replace the battery if this is achieved. But capacity is the key in any question over whether supercapacitors replace batteries. In the Lloyd's research, hundreds of professionals in the renewables, storage and nuclear sectors were asked which technologies will have the greatest impact on the energy sector. Experts replied as follows for storage: Despite the No. 1 spot for supercapacitors in the survey, both Attwood and Chris Robinson, a consultant at Lux Research, were skeptical that the technology will have an outsized impact on the future of storage. However, the technology could have plenty to offer both stationary and mobile applications. Supercapacitors have many complementary properties to batteries. They lend themselves well to high-power applications, can be charged and discharged very quickly, and can operate at low temperatures, all of which can be difficult for most batteries,\" said Attwood. By pairing the two, battery lifetimes and operating temperatures can be increased by using the supercapacitor to provide that first burst of power. A battery like lithium-ion can then take over for steady, longer-duration discharge, as these batteries have a much higher energy density than current supercapacitors,\" she said. Judicious use of supercapacitors can take the strain off a lithium-ion battery designed primarily to deliver energy over a number of hours. Supercapacitors manufacturer Maxwell Technologies is currently using the technology to provide voltage stabilization and stop-start systems, and claims to have units installed in a million vehicles. And Oliver Ahlberg, co-founder and chief operating officer of Estonian supercapacitor manufacturer Skeleton Technologies, said his companys supercapacitors could allow manufacturers to reduce the size of a traditional engine from 14 liters down to 8 liters. Recovering braking power for use in acceleration is another area where supercapacitors can benefit vehicles, by absorbing and storing much of the kinetic energy from the braking system as electricity so that it can be used later. In the case of trains, considerable savings can be made, prompting different networks, including Beijing Metro and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority to deploy them. SEPTA is even selling the recovered energy back to the grid. Stationary storage can benefit from supercapacitors, too. Duke Energy is using Maxwell supercapacitors to support Aquion Energys large-scale batteries for a demonstration project in North Carolina. The supercapacitor element of this Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) will be able to respond very rapidly to sudden changes in input from a nearby solar array caused by cloud cover. It will also reduce heat stress and degradation in the battery component, said the companies. Supercapacitors could also provide a HESS with excellent frequency response capabilities, said Robinson of Lux Research. One forecast estimated that the global market for supercapacitorswill reach $5 billion by 2025. According to Robinson, the technology will certainly find its niche.

{"body": " Sungevity billed itself as a lean, \"asset-light\" residential solar company that could scale faster than the vertically integrated leaders like SolarCity, Vivint and Sunrun. The company just got leaner. The solar firm laid off 66 employees from its Oakland headquarters January 12, government documents show. That was just under two weeks from the day that a plannedreverse merger with shell company Easterly Corporationfell through. The merger, announced last June, was meant to inject$200 million in capital to keep the solar operation running as cash ran low. Sungevity had never operated profitably in its nine years, but projected an inflection point in 2017. With that once-secure investment suddenly withdrawn, the company has scrambled to cut costs and find last-minute sources of capital. The financial troubles of this company, ranked fifth on GTM Research's residential solar installation leaderboard, complicate the search for a truly profitable residential solar business model. Even as installations set new records and overall solar employment booms, the national firms at the top of the solar food chain have struggled to both scale up and make money. Sungevity's approach sounded good on paper: use software to generate quotes without the need for site visits, but outsource the hardware, installation and financing, keeping those off the balance sheet. The company could focus on customer relations without investing in all the capital-intensive parts of the solar business. A Forbes article from September called Sungevity's platform \"a sophisticated departure from the way companies usually sell customers on solar.\" The company's branding long made clear the areas where it doesn't try to make its money, but lately it's been harder to tell where it does. Sungevity's market share peaked at 2.5 percent in 2014 and was at 1.6 percent in Q3 2016, and total capacity installed peaked in Q1 2016, according to GTM Research data. Even the lead generation, which appeared to be a key value-add of the model, was going out the door as Sungevity focused on turning itself into a \"platform.\" A document prepared for the merger in June projected that by 2018, 60 percent of sales would be generated by channel partners rather than Sungevity itself. \"Sungevity has started relying more on sales through channel partners as opposed to direct sales,\" said Nicole Litvak, a senior analyst who covers the residential solar landscape at GTM Research. \"Theyre also not doing the financing, and theyre not doing the installation. Really, theyre mostly a software company at this point.\"  GTM hasreported that Sungevity garnered a total of $850 million in VC and project financing, with an estimated $200 million of that coming as equity funding. Burning through millions is common among solar companies scaling up nationwide, and Sungevity was no exception. \"Theres a fundamental difference between an asset-light company and a capital-efficient company,\" said one solar investor interviewed for this story. \"The business model makes a tremendous amount of sense on paper, but they just couldnt keep their spend under control.\" The company, which did not respond to requests for comment, reported $14.6 million in cash as of March 31, the same month it laid off 250 employeesin the previous mass layoff. By June 30 that was down to $12.4 million. In that time, its total assets shrank from $162.7 million to $142 million. Seven months have passed since that last disclosure. Where does all the money go in an asset-light business? Not toward buying modules or financing solar loans. The software seems to be the major expense -- the Forbes article said Sungevity invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the web platform. Personnel would be the other biggie, hence the layoffs when cash ran low. The initial innovation that spurred Sungevity's rise was its remote imaging software, which enabled rooftop system design without rolling a van and created the possibility of selling solar over the phone. It could be worthwhile to invest money upfront in a web platform that allows a company to manage solar installations more cheaply than it costs to carry them out on its own. Sungevity, though, consistently spent more than it earned. The software platform reduced costs associated with the traditional solar sales cycle, but not by enough to overcome operational losses. Managing rooftop installations from afar generated its own costs. By choosing the role of solar concierge, Sungevity opted to pay a margin to outside installers, and pay its own employees to check in on the outside installers. That model creates cost opportunities that vertically integrated installers don't face, even as it dodges some challenges that they do face. Had Sungevity viewed itself as a solar software startup and licensed its customer acquisition platform for use by hands-on installers, it may have avoided the capital drain that comes from managing installations. Instead, the leadership split the difference, becoming a software company that's not quite an installer, and an installer that's not quite a software company. If it comes time to sell off the software IP, the company will have a problem: it only ever had one customer, and that customer isn't in a position to write a glowing testimonial. \"The ironic thing here is that local installers actually do need some of the things Sungevity is doing,\" Litvak said. \"Customer acquisition is the biggest challenge, and software is very necessary for that.\" In the last couple of years, Sungevity seized on the vision of itself as a platform to connect customers with a network of solar installers and financiers. This allows it to serve many customers without having to invest in infrastructure in every market. By that point, though, a great deal of VC money had been spent, and market headwinds were blowing against all the national players. The fact that Sungevity still stands today testifies to a last-minute influx of capital, but bridge loans don't support long-term success. Sungevity needs to either break into positive cash flow and survive on its own steam, or clean itself up enough to attract a new investment or acquisition. The January layoffs work toward both ends in a brutal manner. The 250-person cut in March targeted \"field sales personnel and related support functions\" in the least profitable geographies, the company said at the time. The January round targeted fewer, but more senior and highly compensated team members, many of whom had served the company for years. \"Weve been through this before -- the surprise was the depth and type and degree to which they had to make changes,\" said one of the employees laid off in January. \"These cuts are gnarly and deep.\" That outcome marked a sharp turnaround for a workforce that thought the merger was a done deal until Sungevity CEO Andrew Birch announced in December that it might not go through. The confirmation of that fact, for many in the workforce, came through a Greentech Media article published January 3, before the company communicated the development internally. The plan for profitability laid out in the merger documents projected a switch to cash flow positive in 2017. The average price of systems sold was expected to increase slightly, while cost of goods sold per system and variable operating costs per system decrease. The number of residential systems deployed was expected to rise from approximately 9,600 in 2016 to 15,000 in 2017. Sungevity expected that combination to close the gap with $77 million in fixed costs in 2017.  Whether those deployment numbers are achievable or not is debatable. One thing is clear, though: The profitability strategy relies on cheaper equipment and cheaper installs, and those are two areas that Sungevity outsourced to platform partners. What the company could directly control is its fixed costs, like salaries. Cutting those could get the finances into more favorable territory for private equity investment or an acquisition. \"If they could produce the revenue with less opex, theyre selling a cash-flow-positive business,\" the solar investor said. It raises a question, though, of what kind of purchase Sungevity would be. With the reduction in staff who aren't bringing in revenue immediately, the ability to plan for future innovation has been constrained. \"If youre a platform and a year from today youre selling the same thing you are today, youre probably going to be irrelevant,\" said the former employee. \"Youll have a platform for whale oil.\" Sungevity does have an asset in its smaller but growing European operations, based out of the Netherlands. In partnership with utility E.ON, Sungevity also expanded into Germany, a market where, GTM reported, \"the typical solar rooftop costs less -- and customers...tend to pay in cash.\" This is unusual for an American residential solar installer, and a larger company looking to sell solar on both continents could find this attractive. Sungevity's fate does not determine the merits of an asset-light platform model. It could still pull through to the era of profitability. What the history does show is that avoiding large asset costs isn't enough to guarantee residential solar success.", "theme": "Residential Solar", "title": "Struggling Sungevity Lays Off Workers After Merger Falls Through", "comments": "17", "tags": ["residential solar", "reverse merger", "solar", "sungevity"]}

{"body": " Redflow is garnering interest in its zinc-bromine flow batteries from telecommunication companies and other businesses throughout Southeast Asia. Companies in several countries are currently evaluating the Redflow ZBM2 batterys ability to provide backup power to remotely located telecommunication towers, according to trhe battery maker. Last June, Redflow released a version of its flow battery for residential applications. Now it's eyeing the telecom market. \"We currently support integration partners in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines who have sold small systems so telecommunication companies can evaluate our batteries in the field,\" said global sales director Andrew Kempster. Kempster was reticent about revealing exact dates and figures. But he said Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia are in the advanced stages of field trials, and added that those underway in India are progressing well.\" The company hopes to start deployment later in 2017 or 2018. In the meantime, long-term trials aim to demonstrate Redflows claims for longevity and the batterys ability to maintain 100 percent depth of discharge over its lifespan. Additionally, the company is looking to finalize reliable networks of distributors and system integrators that would sell, install and maintain the batteries. Doing so in this region, admitted Kempster, provides some unique challenges that require local knowledge and a lot of patience. Redflow sees Southeast Asian telecom towers as a huge potential market. Many nations in the region have jumped straight to cellular network-based phone and internet services because they lack the copper-based communication networks that exist in more mature economies. As an example, Indonesia alone has around 85,000 towers. Although the vast majority are connected to the grid, their electricity supply is far from reliable so many require a battery backup. Kempster said Redflows 48-volt, 10-kilowatt-hour flow batteries tick all the boxes for deployment in the region. These include the ability to operate up to 50C without active cooling, as well as achieve 100 percent depth of discharge on a daily basis. In addition, the flow batteries are unattractive for thieves. They nearly impossible to re-deploy once stolen. And the construction materials -- mostly plastic -- have minimal resale value. Theyre also fairly heavy. Lead-acid units are typically used for telecom towers in the region. Although relatively cheap, lead-acid is far from ideal in hot climates. According to Sandia Labs: The optimum operating temperature for the lead-acid battery is 25C. As a guideline, every 8C rise in temperature will cut the battery life in half. High depth of discharge also affects lead-acid performance and lifespan. Stolen units are simple to repurpose and have a significant scrap value. Redflow has cut its teeth in the residential market in Australia and New Zealand, with hundreds of domestic flow battery units installed, according to Kempster. As we reported in June last year, abattery storage comparisonby Australian website SolarQuotes showed that the ZCell beats all other residential batteries on the market, including the Tesla Powerwall, on a cost-per-total-warranted-kilowatt-hour basis. The ZBM2 batteries Redflow hopes to sell in Southeast Asia are basically identical to the ZCell storage units currently on sale in New Zealand and Australia, Kempster said. Redflow is also in negotiations to supply storage for telecom tower backup in New Zealand and Australia. The process is taking time due to the risk-averse disposition of telecommunications companies, said Kempster. But there have been significant field trials and verbal agreements to move forward on deployment in both countries. The next few years will be a key period for Redflow as opportunities are opening up in markets like Australia, and it'll be interesting to see if the company is able to gain a significant foothold,\" said Brett Simon, a storage analyst with GTM Research. However, he cautioned: Redflow faces a technology risk challenge, as flow battery technology still hasn't proved commercial bankability and only accounts for a handful of deployments worldwide. If successful in its current established and target markets, Redflow will be eyeing other territories in the region, such as Myanmar and Pakistan, Kempster said. The company is also looking at putting together multiple units to offer larger storage options in tandem with renewables in island communities. The units are highly scalable, said Kempster, and so are the commercial possibilities. In fact, Redflow already has a 660-kilowatt-hour array up and running -- at its CEOs offices in Adelaide.", "theme": "Energy Storage", "title": "Can Flow Batteries Beat Lead-Acid in Asias Telecom Market?

{"body": " Followingthe acquisition of sister solar company SolarCity last year -- and a near record-high stock price last week -- electric-car maker Tesla plans to reveal its fourth-quarter and 2016 annual earnings on Wednesday after the market closes. This will be the first time Tesla will reveal plans to integrate SolarCitys financials. The results will help investors understand whether the solar installer will be a boon or a burden. Tesla has argued that the union could save the companies moneyin the long term through synergies. Teslas upcoming shareholder letter, followed by an earnings call led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, could offer detailed information about Teslas reservations for the Model 3, the companys $35,000 car due out at the end of this year. Its important for Tesla to deliver its Model 3 car on time -- and up to its high standards -- in order to beat the growing competition, assure customers and investors that its on track, and prove it can become a mainstream automaker. Those two major undertakings -- a new car and a new company -- dont even account for half of what Tesla will likely focus on in its financial reveal. The company will also likely update investors on its massive battery factory, its car shipment details and its grid battery business that hasmade progress in recent weeks. Here are all the things that well have our eye on for Teslas fourth-quarter and annual 2016 earnings announcement on Wednesday. Tesla reportedly plans to pause production at its factory in Fremont, California sometime this month to prepare for the Model 3 in July. Reuters also reported that Tesla plans to start test production on the Model 3 this week, which would give Musk some good news to drop on the earnings call.  Tesla says it still plans to make 500,000 cars annually (including its Model S, X and 3) starting in 2018. However, the electric-car maker has a long history of missing production targets and overestimating the speed with which it can get cars to customers.  Tesla hasnt given an update since spring of 2016 for the number of Model 3 reservations. Back then it had close to 400,000 Model 3s reserved by potential customers, who each put down a $1,000 refundable deposit. Some of those customers waited overnight outside of Tesla stores to get in line for a chance to make an early reservation -- before the design of the car was even unveiled. Musk has called the process the biggest one-week launch of any product ever. Customers with late reservations might not get their Model 3 for years. The excitement over the Model 3 is partly whats been boosting Teslas stock in recent weeks. Last Tuesday, shares reached $287.39, a 52-week high.  Expect Tesla, or Musk, to give an update on the Model 3s production progress and provide the latest reservation numbers. Will they be up? Or will customers deem the line too long at this point to even bother getting on the list?  The solar installer, led by Musks cousin Lyndon Rive, faced financialheadwinds last year and projected a slowdown of solar installations this year. The company has consistently lost money, and its stock dropped steadily in the year before the Tesla acquisition. Expect the earnings call to cover how the company will integrate SolarCity into Teslas business. Will the company fold SolarCity into Tesla Energy, or keep it as a separate solar business unit? The SolarCity brand is expected to disappear, replaced by Teslas brand, so dont expect the SolarCity name to remain in the financial breakout. Some analysts called Teslas acquisition of SolarCity a bailout for the solar company. But Musk said SolarCity will save the combined companies $150 million and add $500 million in cash to the combined entity's balance sheet over three years.  The companies argue that Teslas stores will be important sales channels for solarsystems, combined with the Tesla-made grid battery packs. Some of SolarCitys highest costs have been for customer acquisition, so reducing those costs is necessary. Expect Musk to be rosy about SolarCitys financials -- even though investors are skeptical. Hes begun to steer the company toward premium products, like the mysterious solar roof, and away from the race-to-the-bottom commodity of solar panels. Will Musk talk about SolarCityas a services company or a technology company? SolarCitybeen pretty quiet on progress at its planned solar factory in upstate New York. Now that Musk has brought in Panasonic as a partner, will we hear about any progress on this front? Tesla and Panasonic started making batteries at the massive battery factory outside Reno, Nevada in December. The batteries are already being used in Teslas grid-scale products and are planned for the Model 3 as well. These batteries are an important way for Tesla to lower battery costs and try to meet the low cost target of its $35,000 Model 3. Ina promo video, Tesla now claims it can achieve a 35 percent cost reduction through its Gigafactory -- an even more aggressive cost drop than previously anticipated. Expect Tesla to give an update on how much construction has been completed at the Gigafactory, and what volume of the larger format batteries are now being used in packs for products. When I visited last July, construction was only 14 percent complete. Tesla already announced that the company shipped 22,200 cars in the fourth quarter of 2016. Last year's car shipments amounted to 76,233 units, which fell below Teslas initial guidance of 80,000 to 90,000. Tesla missed its car shipment predictions for three out of four quarters in 2016. The company struggled to increase production of the Model S at the same time it started shipping the Model X, its SUV-crossover car. Now that Tesla is adding the Model 3 to the production mix, everything is about to get more complicated. To accommodate its manufacturing boost, Tesla could double the size of its factory in Fremont. Teslas shipment numbers are an important indicator of how well the company can predict and meet its goals. They could also be important when it comes to raising more funding from the public markets this year.  Musk has consistently downplayed these quarterly shipment numbers. He says it's hard to predict exactly when the company works through kinks in producing a new car.  Last month,Tesla showed off a large battery installation for Southern California Edison near Los Angeles.While Tesla is still relatively new at the grid-scale storage development business, its Tesla Energy division is growing a strong portfolio. Tesla has battery farms under construction or built in Hawaii, Connecticut, North Carolina, New Zealand and the U.K. At what point does this business get large enough that it starts to rival the car business? Will Musk comment on his discussions with President Donald Trump in the earnings call? He'll likely avoid that topic. But he's come under fire for staying on the president's business advisory council, so it may come up. Musk is walking a fine line by aligning himself with Trump. While the move could put him in the good graces of Trump, it could also tarnish Teslas brand. So far, he's avoided the fate of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.", "theme": "Electric Vehicles", "title": "Tesla Hasnt Revealed Earnings Since It Acquired SolarCity.

Mexicos permitting scheme was not getting the job done, and while there was an abundance of small power producers and self-supply permits, an 8-gigawatt pipeline of projects was not getting off the ground, said GTM Research solar analyst Manan Parikh in a presentation. Those projects have not disappeared. They now have the chance to move forward, said Parikh, who led the seminar organized by GTM. Solar currently accounts for 19 percent of Mexicos renewables capacity, compared with winds 81 percent. That amounts to 3.8 gigawatts of wind and 390 megawatts of solar. Parikh labeled the March tender \"the Yucatan auction\" because the state secured one-third of the capacity awarded, despite having the highest nodal prices. That raised speculation that the region, along with Baja California Sur, was given a \"price handicap\" to make it more competitive. While expectations were tempered going into the second auction in September, solar dominated again. Prices were 34 percent lower than in the first action, at $26.99 per megawatt-hour in the northern state of San Luis Potos, and averaging $36.12 across the country. The highest prices were in Chihuahua, at above $49 per megawatt-hour. The September auction also marked the entry of new names, such as Engie and Enel Green Power,as developers look to diversify their portfolios. Mexicos auctions follow a distinct trend across Latin America over the last four years. With auctions becoming more common in the region, prices continue to hit record lows. The Mexican auctions supported both the largest capacity projects and the lowest prices in the region. In the third auction, which will kick off in April, state utility CFE will no longer be the sole purchaser. A trading house will be established to award and manage contracts with the winners, according to Luz Aurora Ortiz Salgado, deputy director general at the energy ministrys national electricity system and nuclear policy unit. With the CFE no longer the sole bidder, price competitiveness is expected to increase. The publication of regulations for distributed generation by the government last December will also give solar a boost, said Ortiz Salgado. Solar growth in Mexico will likely spawn local component manufacturing as the industry looks to avoid the 15 percent import tax currently levied on solar panels, she added. Parikh estimates upfront costs to be closer to $70 per megawatt-hour. If prices go any lower, projects will cease to be viable. He also forecast that winning solar projects in the next auction will likely be closer to the countrys central region and the major manufacturing centers, as well as in the Bajo region, which is a hotbed of automotive production. Price expectations for the third auction were between $30-$40 per megawatt-hour among the majority of respondents to GTMs in-seminar survey. However, after Mexicos peso suffered in the wake of President Trump's election, currency depreciation remains a concern. Currency risks could [scuttle] all of the progress, Parikh said. Other risks could emerge from a renegotiationor scrapping of NAFTA, although such a scenario could benefit Mexico in the long term as it seeks to build trade ties with other markets. Solar demand may grow to 4 gigawatts by 2020, according to local solar power association Asolmex, which forecasts $5 billion in investment in the solar sector to that date. Falling component prices will make solar more attractive. But despite a 20 percent drop in module costs in Mexico over the last five years, the country has only seen a 10 percent decline in overall system pricing. The country is lagging behind the U.S., where customers have seen a 45 percent decline in system pricing, and where $1 per megawatt-hour is achievable over the next 10 years, according to MJ Shiao, GTMs director of solar research. Mexico and other Latin American countries are expected to join that trend as prices fall at auction, and solar becomes increasingly competitive against other energy sources. Latin America is becoming a significant solar player on the world stage, accounting for 10 percent of the global industry, Shiao said. And Mexico is on the right track in terms of its energy reform, according to Brett Blankenship, a research director at Wood Mackenzie. Mexico is moving toward a wholesale power market, its reform has drawn on successful models from around the world, and its long-term contracts deliver price certainty,\" said Blankenship. Blankenship said load growth is the single most important thing to watch. Load growth is seen rising to 500 terawatt-hours by 2035, while load intensity to GDP is seen dropping to below 200 gigawatt-hours per peso of GDP by 2034. The load will dictate demand for clean energy resources,\" he said. By 2050, said Blankenship, clean energy will likely make up half of Mexico's generation, \"dominated by solar.\" *** For more insight into Latin America's solar market, downlod the latest executive summary of GTM Research's Latin America PV Playbook.", "theme": "Markets & Policy", "title": "Mexican Solar Market in a Comfortable Spot as Auctions Spur Project Surge", "comments": "2", "tags": ["gtm research", "mexico", "solar auctions", "solar pricing"]}
{"body": " Blockchain, the technology underpinning the Bitcoinvirtual currency, is being discussed as one of the most potentially disruptive technologies since the internet. Blockchains are a combination of information technology, cryptography and governance principles that enable transactions to occur without the need for a third party to establish trust between transacting parties. In todays transactions, a number of human processes and institutions -- such as banks, lawyers, regulators, brokers and utilities -- are paid to establish trust. Blockchain technology replaces these institutions, making it possible to conduct transactions without a third-party intermediary. At Rocky Mountain Institute, we believe that blockchain technology has the potential to play a significant, potentially game-changing role in the global electricity systems transition to a more secure, resilient, cost-effective, and low-carbon grid. In the face of aggressive growth in distributed energy resources (DERs) -- such as rooftop solar, demand response, and electric vehicles -- governments, utilities, and other stakeholders from across the globe are experimenting with new ways to better regulate and manage the electricity grid. These experiments currently face four main issues regardless of their geography. Although it is not yet 100 percent clear how, blockchain technology may be capable of solving these challenges:  To unlock this value and help accelerate blockchain technology development in the electricity sector, RMI andGrid Singularity-- an Austria-based blockchain technology developer -- formed theEnergy Web Foundation(EWF). EWF is a nonprofit foundation with one high-level goal: to unleash the potential of blockchain technology in the energy sector. To achieve this goal, EWF focuses ondefiningblockchain use cases,buildinga blockchain platform for the energy sector,incubatingan ecosystem of stakeholders, andeducatingthe public. When technologists connected individual computers via phone lines to exchange packets of information in the late 1960s, no one knew exactly what the technology -- which would eventually become the internet -- was capable of. Sending digitally signed messages, or email, was immediately seen as a clear and interesting application, but not much else. In other words, the beginnings of the internet looked intriguing, but nobody quite knew the extent of what it could do. Blockchain technology in the energy sector is at a very similar early stage. We understand, at pilot scale, how to connect electricity loads, generators, and everything in between (e.g., distribution lines and batteries) to a blockchain ecosystem in order to track flows of energy and value while allowing multiple parties to transact. The most discussed blockchain pilots demonstrate this basic functionality, with small-scale rooftop solar customers exchanging green attributes of power in places likeNew York CityandAustralia. But small-scale peer-to-peer use cases like these are just the tip of the iceberg. Even to blockchain experts, its still unclear exactly where the technologys value lies and what the roadmap to commercial implementation looks like in the energy sector. Research organizations have identifiedmore than 200 applications of blockchain technology. EWF will conduct detailed research and analysis on these use cases to identify exactly what blockchain technology can be used for in todays electricity sector, how much economic value the technology can unlock, and what it will take for applications to be deployed at scale. Thus, EWF can help key stakeholder groups -- electricity regulators, ratepayer advocate groups, and the public -- better understand the benefits of blockchain technology and ease the technologys path to market. Imagine for a moment you are the chief executive of Snapchat (or any other popular mobile phone application) five years before its application becomes one of the most-used in history. Now, imagine that you have built your application, but platforms like Apples iOS operating system or Googles Android simply dont exist. In this alternate history, Snapchat would not only need to build its application, but it would also need to build an entire operating system capable of running the application on mobile devices everywhere -- a massive undertaking. This is exactly where blockchain technology is in the energy sector today. Currently, aselect few utilities are experimentingwith blockchain pilots. These pilots typically consist of defining a use case (e.g., peer-to-peer exchange of excess rooftop solar energy), writing software to turn the use case into an application, and then running the applications on a platform. To date, each utility has either built its own platform or used an existing public platform (likeEthereumor Bitcoin) to run its application. Instead of developing proprietary platforms, EWF sees an opportunity for energy market participants to jointly fund and develop a single blockchain platform for the global energy sector. EWF will capture this opportunity by bringing together dozens of stakeholders and building an open-source blockchain platform. Organizations representing distribution utilities, traders, customers, and financiers will be able to build energy-focused applications on top of this shared, open-source blockchain. Likewise, instead of utilities, regulators, and grid operators conducting individual pilots, we aim to position EWF as the central convening platform to bring together energy-focused blockchain efforts everywhere and accelerate the pace of blockchain development through a combination of hackathons, boot camps, and other gatherings. *** Jesse Morris is a principal in the electricity and transportation practices of the Rocky Mountain Institute.

{"body": " After decades of technology development, business model innovation and policy progress, the U.S. economy is now decisively growing -- independent of energy consumption and carbon emissions. Since 2007, U.S. GDP has grown by 12 percent, while energy consumption has fallen by 3.6 percent, according to the new 2017 Sustainable Energy in America Factbook, compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) for the Business Council for Sustainable Energy (BCSE). This years fifth edition report builds on last years Factbook findings that show the U.S. economy grew by 10 percent since 2007, while energy consumption fell by 2.4 percent. In other words, energy productivity continues to improve as less and less energy is needed to fuel growth, the authors wrote. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions are plummeting. Total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions hit a 25-year low in 2016, down 12 percent from their peak in 2007 and 11.6 percent below 2005 levels. That puts the U.S. nearly halfway toward its Paris Agreement pledge to reduce national emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Reductions are even more notable within the power sector, which saw greenhouse gas emissions fall by 5.3 percent in 2016 alone. The power sectors carbon footprint has shrunk by 24 percent since 2005, thanks in large part to market forces that increased the availability of lower-carbon energy resources -- namely the boom in domestic natural-gas production, a dramatic reduction in renewable energy prices, and expanded adoption of energy efficiency measures.  As a result, the U.S. is already three-quarters of the way toward meeting President Obamas Clean Power Plan target to reduce emissions by 32 percent by 2030, with 14 years remaining.  The Factbook isnt the first report to show that U.S. economic development has decoupled from energy demand and carbon emissions, but it shows that the trend is growing. Still, there continues to be pushback against climate action in the U.S. over fears that it will hurt the economy. During President Trumps first week in office, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the new administration would seek to balance the economy and environmental issues, such as climate change. [President Trump] is going to meet with his team and figure out what policies are best for the environment, said Spicer. One of the things he talked about during the campaign is theres a balance, and hes trying to make sure that we use our resources appropriately, that we maximize things to make sure that we dont do so at the detriment of economic growth and job creation. Statistics included in the 2017 Factbook show that the U.S. has been able to sustain significant economic growth while transitioning toward cleaner energy resources. Furthermore, Americans are spending less on energy than at any other time on record. Consumers devoted less than 4 percent of their total annual household spending to energy in 2016, the smallest share ever recorded by the U.S. government, according to the report. Retail electricity prices across the U.S. fell by 1.3 percent in 2016, compared to 2015 levels. On average, consumers now pay 3 percent less per kilowatt-hour for electricity than in 2007, adjusting for inflation. In some regions, the savings are even higher, as in Texas, where average retail rates have fallen by 29 percent. The U.S. continues to use energy more efficiently and with lower CO2 emissions, while at the same time cutting consumer spending, said Colleen Regan, head of North America Power and Environmental Markets at BNEF, in a statement. 2016 offered further proof that we can decarbonize and grow our economy, all without raising customer bills. Last year marked another monumental year in the energy sector, the Factbook authors wrote, with the ongoing transformation of how the U.S. produces and consumes energy. Avoided energy use was one of the most significant changes. Last year, overall energy consumption fell by 0.2 percent, while GDP grew by 1.6 percent. Energy-efficiency improvements were particularly pronounced in the power sector, where electricity demand dropped by 1.1 percent in 2016, compared to a 1.6 percent increase in annual GDP. Electricity demand is down 1.2 percent from its 2014 peak, while GDP has grown by 4.2 percent, according to the 2017 Factbook.  This boost comes as utilities have tripled their spending on energy-efficiency programs, from $2.2 billion in 2007 to $6.3 billion in 2015 (the latest year for which data is available). At the same time, clean energy deployments have boomed. The U.S. added 22 gigawatts of renewable generating capacity last year, setting a new record for annual renewable energy capacity additions. More than half of these additions (12.5 gigawatts) came from the solar industry. Wind additions totaled 8.5 gigawatts last year, with hydropower, biomass, biogas and waste-to-energy making up the remainder. Overall, renewable energy production has grown from 9 percent of the U.S. electricity mix in 2007, to 15 percent in 2016. Success in the renewables sector has been due to low and declining prices. Solar module prices have fallen 90 percent below 2008 levels, and wind is now competitive with fossil fuels in many regions of the country. Sustainable energy is now the new normal, the report states.  The fossil-fuel sector is evolving too. Natural gas is now the No. 1 source of power in the U.S., making up 34 percent of the electricity mix in 2016, up from 22 percent in 2007. Meanwhile, aging and increasingly uneconomic coal plants have struggled to compete. Last year saw 7 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity disconnect from the grid, after a record 15 gigawatts retired in 2015, according to the Factbook. Coal now provides 30 percent of U.S. electricity generation -- the smallest share of power ever recorded. While the electricity sector is rapidly becoming cleaner, the transportation sector has been slow to shift. After a slump in 2015, U.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales increased 38 percent last year -- driven largely by the release of the new Chevy Volt and a continued strong performance from Tesla. But overall EV sales amounted to just under 160,000 units last year, which represents a tiny portion of the 17.55 million total vehicles sold. Gas-guzzling vehicle sales surged as oil prices remained low throughout the year, and gasoline purchases rose by 3.3 percent. Because of this trend, recent gains in fuel economy are at risk of being erased, according to the Factbook. Automakers are currently mandated to improve vehicle efficiency under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. On January 13, the EPA announced it will stick to the CAFE target of 54.5 miles per gallon for light-duty vehicles released in model year 2025. But the fate of the rule rests with President Trump, who has already expressed interest in rolling back Obama-era environmental regulations. Trumps America First energy strategy includes throwing out the Clean Power Plan, which was stalled last year in the courts. Additional regulations could also be eliminated, and federally run clean energy programs could soon see their budgets cut under a Republican-run Congress. Policy shifts at the federal level will make state-level policies equally if not more important in driving the clean energy transition. Corporate investments are also expected to play an important role in expanding the U.S. renewable energy market. At the same time, companies -- and large industrial players in particular -- stand to benefit from low U.S. energy prices. The contributions of sustainable energy to the countrys economic competitiveness are direct, dramatic and dynamic, said Lisa Jacobson, president ofBCSE, in a statement. The trend lines in the 2017 Factbook are clear: Energy efficiency, natural gas and renewable energy are benefiting American consumers, American businesses and American manufacturers. And that adds up to one conclusion: clean energy wins for America.", "theme": "Energy Efficiency", "title": "The New Normal in America: Renewables Boom, Emissions Plunge and Consumers Save More Than Ever", "comments": "26", "tags": ["bnef", "clean power plan", "coal", "decoupling", "energy efficiency", "greenhouse gas emissions", "obama", "solar", "sustainable energy in america factbook", "trump", "wind"]}
{"body": " Wall Street analysts are once again cautioning the market not to underestimate distributed energy technologies. Over the years, Goldman Sachs, UBSand Morgan Stanley have all warned investors about the disruptive potential of wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles on energy markets. This week, Morgan Stanley says the growth of battery storage is \"underappreciated\" by many in the electricity business. According to a new report from the firm, the U.S. addressable market for energy storage totals $30 billion without significant regulatory change. If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission clears the way for storage deployments in deregulated markets, though, the storage market could become 70 percent larger. That's bad news for companies with lots of natural-gas generation in markets favorable to storage, but good news for Tesla and LG Chem, which the analysts predict will control the industry. Equity analyst Stephen Byrd and his co-authors calculate the actual annual demand for storage will rise from less than $300 million currently to $2 billion to $4 billion by 2020. For comparison, GTM Research pegs the U.S. storage market at $408 million for 2016, growing to $2.1 billion in 2020. That puts the Wall Street titan on roughly the same page as the clean energy research specialists when it comes to the growth of energy storage. That's worth taking a moment to absorb. One of the key obstacles storage vendors have encountered is a lack of access to capital for investment and project financing. Most banks have been leery of putting their balance sheet behind newly developed chemistries from companies that have only existed for a decade or less. With firms like Morgan Stanley offering stock assessments based on an expanded market for energy storage, new sources of capital could soon be opening up for battery makers. The question, then, is which ones. The authors think the market \"will be dominated by two suppliers, Tesla and LG Chem,\" due to their prominent roles currently and their immense production capacity coming on-line in the next few years. The base case has Tesla reaching 30 percent U.S. market share, and the bullish case puts it at 50 percent. This framing ignores a bustling menagerie of battery companies all jostling to break out, however. Tesla certainly has a lead on U.S. manufacturing with its Gigafactory, but it seems premature to crown it the king just yet. To take one example, utilities need to see how Tesla's Powerpack batteries hold up to real-world cycling in the field. If issues arise with the initial round of utility-scale battery deployments after a few years, it could hamper the company's market dominance. There are also more competitors with massive production facilities. Mercedes-Benz, for instance, only recently entered the U.S. market, but has invested 1 billion euros in scaling its battery factories. Like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz aims to ride the coming wave of electric-vehicle sales to scale its stationary storage business. There are also other established Asian mega-producers like LG Chem. BYD, Toshiba, NEC and Samsung SDI all rank highly in global storage deployments. It's true that LG Chem has a production base in Michigan to supply American electric-car makers, and the political winds are blowing in the direction of \"Made in the USA.\" But those competitors enjoy similarly large factory facilities and global distribution networks, and should not be discounted. Readers of the report could walk away with the impression that lithium-ion is the only game in town. Flow batteries haven't posted the kind of run time that lithium-ion batteries have, and big capital wants to see more operating data before opening the checkbook. Proponents of this technology, though, think it is ready to carve out significant market share from lithium-ion for longer-duration applications. Lithium-ion accounted for 96.2 percent of the U.S. market in Q3 2016, so alternative chemistries are unlikely to play a dominant role in the market by 2020. But they could develop into a more substantial role in the years beyond. The authors observe that utilities will drive most of the storage sales: \"There are numerous customer benefits that a utility can factor into its decision to invest in storage, and this 'scope of benefits' is, we think, much broader than the scope of any other business model.\" Utilities are in a position to pay for multiple uses of batteries for the grid -- to integrate intermittent renewables, to defer transmission upgrades, etc. -- that improve the economics compared to what a merchant developer can monetize. The use applications of utility storage are becoming clear in California, thanks to a state mandate of 1.3 gigawatts of storage by 2020. The Morgan Stanley analysts address the impacts of the storage surge in their evaluation of Calpine, which owns a fleet of natural-gas plants in California. \"We expect the state to increase its current storage procurement targets, reducing the need for conventional gas generation. As a result, we are taking a more conservative view on CPN's California fleet.\" The upshot: The authorsreduced their price target for Calpine from $18 to $13. This doesn't mean it's time to run out and buy any battery company stock you can get your hands on. But the analysis does indicate that advanced batteries are starting to shift investor calculations on the future profitability of certain fossil-fuel generators.", "theme": "Energy Storage", "title": "Morgan Stanley: Storage in the Utility Sector Will Grow More Than the Market Anticipates", "comments": "1", "tags": ["batteries", "energy storage", "flow batteries", "lg chem", "lithium-ion", "morgan stanley", "samsung sdi", "tesla"]}
{"body": " 2017 is going to be a tricky year for the U.S. solar industry. Fewer PV panels will be deployed across the U.S. than in 2016. However, despite a slightly contracting market (a rarity in the history of this industry), the U.S. will still install an estimated 13.7 gigawatts this year. That's going to keep a lot of employees busy even while costs for solar systems continue to fall. The number of jobs created to make, sell and install solar panels in the U.S. grew at a record pace last year, and grew much faster than the overall American economy, as per a new report from The Solar Foundation. The report found that there were 260,077 solar workers as of November 2016 -- an increase of 51,000 jobs, up 25 percent over 2015. That high job-growth rate is unlikely to continue into 2017. The report estimates that the job growth rate will be closer to 10 percent this year. That's the relatively good news. Although 2017 is going to be a mostly flat year for solar industry revenue, it will still be a year where market leadership in installation, modules, inverters and balance-of-system technology remains highly competitive and volatile. And that means there are going to be some casualties. OneRoof Energy is (was?) a second-tier residential solar financier that never seemed to get enough market traction, while making some counterintuitive business moves.  Late last month, OneRoof issued a release revealing that it was \"in default under its head office lease for failure to pay rent. This default also creates a default under the Companys secured loan facilities, giving the secured lenders the right to accelerate and demand immediate payment of all outstanding balances, including principal and accrued interest, under such loans, totaling approximately $100 million in the aggregate. The Companys liabilities under the secured loan facilities greatly exceeds the value of its assets, and an acceleration of the secured loans could result in the foreclosure of all or substantially all of the Companys assets.\" OneRoof raised a lot of money. In 2013, OneRoof added $100 million from Morgan Stanley and Main Street Power Company to its funds. OneRoof raised more than $80 million in operating and finance capital from Hanwha, Black Coral Capital, U.S. Bank, The Quercus Trust, Yellowtree Energy, GDF SUEZ Energy and Spring Ventures. In 2014, the firm gained access to funding as a public company via a reverse merger on Tier 2 of the TSX Venture Exchange, that innovation hotbed. During this \"winding down\" period, Senior VP Dalton Sprinkle will shift his $280,000 per year salary to a daily rate of $2,800 per day. CEO David Field will now get a severance payment of $266,000 if \"substantially all of the Companys solar project assets are subject to definitive sale or refinancing agreements on or prior to February 28, 2017, or if he is terminated prior to February 28, 2017 without Cause or resigns for Good Reason.\" If the conditions aren't met, Field would get $133,000. The CEO once told GTM, My business is the acquisition of non-regulated customers. It is not necessarily the business of putting solar on rooftops.\" We've been following the travails of PV microinverter pioneer Enphase as it struggles to regain its footing. In early January, T.J. Rodgers, founder of Cypress Semiconductor, and John Doerr, chairman of Kleiner Perkins, invested $10 million in the firm. Rodgers joined the board of directors. A release describing the investment included this information: \"Enphase anticipates using a portion of this investment for consulting services to optimize operating performance while supporting the growing global demand for its energy management systems.\" Those \"consulting services\" translated to McKinsey being hired, according to an investor note from Roth Capital, followed by McKinsey doing what McKinsey does. On January 30 Enphase reduced its workforce by \"approximately 18 percent of total headcount throughout all areas of the organization to lower operating expenses.\" That's roughly 80 jobs. Enphase estimates it will incur \"approximately $2 million in cash-based termination costs.\" This cut follows a layoff of 11 percent of its workforce in September 2016. In 2013, GTM Research named American Solar Direct as a residential PV installer to watch. At the time, ASD was one of the few top-20 installers that had experienced consistent, positive quarter-over-quarter growth since it began installing PV systems in 2010. The company, founded in 2009, began in Los Angeles and expanded to San Diego and Northern California in 2012. ASD raised its own project funds and received two rounds of equity investment, as well as $50 million to support its lease program from WGL Holdings, parent company of utility Washington Gas. A year ago, American Solar Direct won an undisclosed amount of funding from Dubai-based Adenium Capital. But recently, ASD has had a round of layoffs, aimed at \"low producers,\" as well as some office consolidation, according to CEO Andrew Schneider. He noted that despite the layoffs, the situation was full speed ahead at the company, which had its first cash-flow positive months in November and December and partnered with Swell Energy on energy storage.", "theme": "Solar Finance & VC", "title": "Hard Times in the Land of Plenty: OneRoof, American Solar Direct and Enphase", "comments": "12", "tags": ["american solar direct", "enphase", "oneroof energy", "residential solar", "skull", "solar jobs"]}
{"body": " Bloomberg:After Trump Fallout, Uber Cant Shake Its Elon Musk Envy While Uber got shellacked for its link to President Donald Trump, the electric carmaker and sometimes-rival Tesla Inc. has comfortably weathered its association with a president who has lower approval ratings than any predecessor in his first days in office. Uber Technologies Inc. lost customers and drivers and became the subject of a campaign on Twitter that encouraged people to delete their Uber apps.

Associated Press: Renewable Energy Can Help Trump Create Jobs, Says Jimmy Carter Former President Jimmy Carter said Wednesday millions of jobs could be created in the United States if President Donald Trump embraced renewable energy sources such as geothermal, solar and wind power. Carter, a Democrat who was the first U.S. president to install solar panels at the White House, said he hoped the Republican Trump would give it \"deep consideration.\" \"Sometimes there's a philosophical objection to this by some -- I'll say right-wing Republicans -- but he has a high priority of job creation,\" Carter said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"If they just remember the tremendous potential of creating millions of jobs in America just from renewable energy sources, that would be a very good counter-argument to those who oppose the concept of global warming being caused by human activity.\" Guardian:Electricity Market Operator Denies Being Asleep at the Wheel During Blackout The Australian Energy Market Operator says it was not asleep at the wheel after another electricity shortage in South Australia on Wednesday caused blackouts for 40,000 people. Senior managers from the electricity market operator faced combative questioning about their management of the South Australian weather event during a Senate committee hearing in Canberra on Friday. As other states battled extreme temperatures, and faced the risk of blackouts, and as political debate continued to rage about energy policy, David Swift, executive general manager of corporate development at Aemo, defended the performance of his agency despite admitting there had been an error in their forecasting on the day of the blackout this week. We certainly werent asleep at the wheel, Swift told the committee. Engadget:Researchers Make a Graphene Superconductor Graphene is the miracle cream of the physics world, with scientists all across the globe looking to unlock its powers. Researchers at the University of Cambridge believe they've found a way to transform the substance into a superconductor. Superconductors are nothing new, of course, but they normally have to be cooled to very low temperatures to be effective. In this experiment, however, the materials were left at the current temperature. Now, like so many graphene projects, it's still early days, but if it works, it could upend the way we build electronics forever. All materials have a level of resistance, which is a measure of the fight it puts up to stop electricity passing through it. A copper wire, for instance, has quite a low level, which is why it's used a lot to build electronics and computers. Wood's at the other end of the spectrum, at least when it's dry, which is why your smartphone isn't hewn from trees. Reuters:EU Softens Proposal on Extension of Chinese Solar Duties The European Commission has proposed extending import duties on solar panels from China by 18 months, a shorter period than initially planned, and with a gradual phase-out, Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said on Wednesday. Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties have been in place on Chinese solar panels and cells since 2013 and are currently under review as to whether they should be maintained. A majority of EU countries last month opposed a proposed two-year extension. Timmermans told a news conference that it was a sensitive issue. The commission's proposal, revealed by Reuters on Tuesday, will be put to the EU's 28 member states later this month.", "theme": "Mobility", "title": "Different Reactions to Uber and Tesla Over Trump Ties Show the Strength of Elon Musks Brand", "comments": "12", "tags": ["editors news feed", "tesla", "uber"]}

{"body": " Despite a massive increase in electric vehicles and other non-conventional cars, the internal combustion engine will still make up 94 percent of all motorized transportation by 2035, according to an Energy Outlook report by BP. Thats because the number of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles is set to double in the same period, says BP. Another 900 million gas guzzlers on the worlds roads in the next 18 years means that demand for oil will continue to rise, as will carbon emissions. BP makes it clear that the International Energy Agencys 450 Scenario targets to stabilize global temperatures will not be met. We expect electric vehicles to carry on growing very rapidly, but on our base case, at least, that wont be a game-changer [to oil consumption],\" said Spencer Dale, BPs group chief economist.   Source: BP Energy Outlook 2017 Far greater savings will be achieved through increases in fuel efficiency plus other innovations such as car sharing, carpooling and autonomous vehicles, according to the report. An average passenger car is expected to achieve almost 50 miles per U.S. gallon in 2035, compared with less than 30 MPG in 2015, concludes the report. Nevertheless, this is a faster rate of efficiency improvement than in the past. Even if these efficiencies are achieved, demand for oil due to transportation will still jump by 4 million barrels a day by 2035, accounting for around a quarter of total growth.  The doubling in ICE vehicles and increase in EVs is due to rising incomes and improving road infrastructure in the developing world -- primarily in China and India. The report is not without its critics. A key reason is the assumptions in BPs base case. This essentially assumes a business-as-usual scenario that underplays the possibilities of decarbonization due to legislation. BPs base case outlook is premised on a demand for fossil fuels that vastly exceeds the carbon budget for limiting temperature rises to 1.5C to 2C, taking a very conservative view on growth in low-carbon technologies, the prospective scaling-up of governmental action, and overlooking the material impacts that such a level of climate change would have on the demand for fossil fuels,\" writes investment watchdogShare Actionin a paper. Dr. Stephen Hall, co-author of the report Business Model Innovation for Electric Vehicle Futures, agreed that a company whose business revolves around selling oil is not necessarily the best judge of how much that market might be undermined in future years. The BP report is one possible future, but they are unlikely to release a report saying otherwise, he commented. Hall told GTM that several different scenarios indicate EVs will make a much bigger dent in the worlds auto sector than BP believes -- from 15 percent to 35 percent, compared to a mere 6 percent predicted by the oil giant. Although he wouldnt give precise numbers, Hall said the social and political pressure for cleaner air, coupled with the economic argument that EV running costs are lower than those for ICE vehicles, would help ensure a massive uptake of EVs. Theres increasing impetus to curtail diesel. Meanwhile, in cities around the world, people are dying prematurely due to gasoline emissions, and pressure is building to make big cuts. City councils are starting to replace ICE buses and other council-owned vehicles with electric vehicles,\" said Hall. The economics of recharging an EV versus filling an ICE gas tank are hard to ignore as well. Its already much cheaper to run an EV than an ICE vehicle. And as the levelized costs of renewable energy continue to fall, and more renewables provide electricity to the grid, that cost will only go down, said Hall. Barriers remain to the mainstreaming of EVs -- particularly the price of new vehicles, range issues and availability of charging points. However, even BP admits there will be large numbers on the roads within 20 years. The question is how much of a positive impact they will have in curbing emissions.", "theme": "Electric Vehicles", "title": "BP Predicts 100 Million EVs on the Road by 2035.

The Motley Fool: In Case You Missed It, This Hasn't Happened in the Solar Industry in 16 Years The solar industry has been on a growth streak for the past 16 years and is now a formidable force in energy. But this year may finally see the growth streak come to an end. According to GTM Research, 2017 is expected to see a 7% decline in installations from 74 GW to 69 GW. This would be a significant downturn after years of growth, but it's not all that surprising to industry observers. First Solar, SunPower, Canadian Solar, and even shares of Tesla in SolarCity were all hammered by this decline before the calendar turned to 2017. While this year may be bad for solar energy, it may be the calm before a wave of installations hits starting in 2018. And if you look out on the horizon the solar future looks to be getting brighter everyday. Associated Press:Big Utilities Try to Tilt Solar Energy Market in Their Favor Indiana's energy utilities want state lawmakers to pass a law that critics say would muscle out smaller companies from the emerging solar energy market. Solar power provides only about 1 percent of the country's energy, but it is growing rapidly, with U.S. Energy Department figures showing solar industry employment grew 125 percent since 2010. Much of the growth has come from homeowners or businesses taking advantage of its bill-lowering potential. That could eventually eat away at the business of the big utilities -- in Indiana, Duke Energy, Vectren and Indiana Michigan Power -- which have a powerful voice and donate handsomely to political campaigns. Scientific American:Do Car Bans Actually Mitigate Air Pollution? In recent months, several cities from Paris to New Delhi have resorted to banning cars to improve worsening air pollution. While some see this as a long-term solution, others question if it is no more than an emergency band-aid on a profusely polluting limb. Air quality can be a hard thing to ascertain, but with increasing air quality monitoring, not to mention social media activity on the topic, air pollution is worsening in many cities, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the transport sector are a major culprit, with deleterious effects including asthma, heart disease, and cancer. Transport alone is not to blame; in many cities there are nearby power stations and/or industrial production, which contribute a large share of pollution, but these are understandably harder for politicians to shift overnight. So when citizens demand action, they sometimes get it, but the question is: is it the right action?

{"body": " Barry Cinnamon wanted to illustrate how a small residential solar installer could profit while selling $2.00-per-watt solar. But he couldn't make the numbers work at $2.00. So, his presentation became \"What Happens When Home Solar Costs are $2.50 per Watt?\" when he spoke at the IEEE PV chapter in Palo Alto, Calif. last week. Cinnamon has worked in the solar-installer long tail most of his solar professional life. Not long ago, the residential installer industry was dominated by small shops, many of which had converted existing business like home improvement or roofing to focus on the emerging field. But the advent of new financing options allowed for massive VC-funded installer growth. SolarCity, the nation's residential solar leader, installed more than a quarter of all U.S. residential PV in 2013. The companies filling the No. 2 through No. 6 spots in the rankings grew from 15 percent to 20 percent in the period 2012-2013. As Andrew Beebe of Obvious Ventures just wrote, \"We are now about to witness a reversal of this consolidation and enter...'the revenge of the long tail,'\" adding, \"This long-tail group is precisely what we need to create a more resilient, dynamic and customer-centric industry.\" Here are the highlights from Cinnamon's presentation. \"I found that the most profitability you can achieve as a residential installer is just being a strong installer in a small market. So those are the two things I do. Spice Solar is a technology company; we sell to other installers all over the country. Cinnamon Solar is just your little local residential installer.\" Citing GTM Research figures, he said: \"We're looking at some pretty rapid growth, in excess of 6 gigawatts a year of residential installations by 2020.\" Then he added, \"These predictions were rock-solid valid -- until November 8th.\"  \"What's happening in the installation business is that the module costs are coming down a lot, the overhead's coming down a little, but the labor costs haven't changed that much. I've looked back at labor data that I had from 10 years ago and it's still about the same per watt. So what happens is, the installer margins are getting squeezed because the top-level price is coming down, but a lot of the remaining costs just don't change.\"  According to Cinnamon, \"Realistically, in 2016, the average residential installation costs are about $3.50 per watt. Now, if you look at the financial statements from some of the publicly traded companies and you're a financial genius, you might be able to figure that out, but it's very hard to determine what that is. But I can tell you, you look at data from GTM, you look at data from NREL, it's about $3.50 per watt.\" He added, \"At Cinnamon Solar, we're doing more and more maintenance because, first of all, inverters that companies like mine put in 10 years ago and 15 years ago, they're failing, they need to get replaced. People want to remove their arrays and fix their roof and put the array back on; the modules are still fine. Unfortunately, I still havent figured out how to profitably do this maintenance. Just rolling a truck with two technicians and appropriate safety gear costs $200.\" \"But it is a good business, because every single one of those customers for whom we do maintenance becomes a referral for us, and referrals are one key to being a profitable installer. Five years from now, the installers that are in business are going to be doing an increasing percentage of their business on maintenance, as you see what happens in other mature industries that are analogous to solar, like HVAC.\"  [Maintenance in red] Cinnamon pegs his inverter cost at $0.45 a watt from a blend of his vendors. \"My company installs mostly SolarEdge right now, SMA string inverters, and once in a while Enphase microinverters. When I look at my fully loaded tax and freight costs including monitoring, an SMA inverter is around $0.37 a watt, a SolarEdge inverter is about $0.47 a watt, and -- this number surprised me -- the Enphase inverter is $0.67 a watt. Now, the prices you hear may be lower because of special incentives and rebates; I'm not going to get into all the kickbacks -- and market development funds that bring those costs down a lot, but the inverters and all their accessories are still kind of pricey.\" \"And there's tremendous potential for companies like Huawei to come out with really cheap inverters,\" said Cinnamon, adding, \"They make good stuff, but is it going to work with the monitoring and the battery systems and have all the capabilities that we want?\"  \"When I look at the average cost of quality racking with grounding and array skirts and everything you need -- splices, flashings, roof hooks and wire clips -- it's about $0.21 a watt. Other components -- electrical boxes, wiring, conduit, nuts, fasteners, safety anchors, sealants, tools  that adds up to $0.12 a watt.\"  \"Note that when I benchmark costs I include applicable sales tax and freight for all components.\" \"Inverter costs will come down with new competition, better functionality integration such as built-in monitoring and module electronics, and higher volume production. We take two steps forward with inverter cost reductions, then we take one step back when we add new functionality such as rapid shutdown and grid interactivity.\" \"Racking costs will also decline as module companies realize they can reduce their customers costs by integrating the mounting systems and grounding into the modules themselves. The weight of the racking alone for a single solar panel is almost 5 pounds. Building that mounting system functionality into the module frame reduces expensive aluminum costs as well as direct and indirect installation labor.\" \"As the efficiency of the module goes up, if the module price doesn't change, then you see significant savings. A rough rule of thumb is for every 5-watt increase in the module output, if you go from a 300 to a 305 watt module, if the module price doesn't change, the customer can get a system that costs $0.04 per watt less. So, there are some significant savings, and this metric works well in the band of 250 to 350 watts. Higher efficiency really reduces cost, but the caveat is that higher efficiency really reduces the cost to the customer only if the cost of the module doesn't go up commensurately.\" \"When I look at my average labor costs for doing a residential installation, even seven or eight years ago, it was still $0.50 a watt. You could call up an installer and say, \"Hey, I've got a bunch of solar panels, I got my permit, I got everything to go, can you just send a crew over to put it in, and many installers would say, '$0.50 a watt.'\" \"For 10 years, I've been trying to reduce the customer acquisition cost for my residential installation companies. What I found when I grew Akeena from four guys and two trucks to offices all over the country -- the bigger I got, the higher my customer acquisition costs got. I thought it would be scalable; it's not. The most cost effective way to get new customers is from referrals, but that technique does not work in rapidly growing markets when the referral base starts from zero. Moreover, regional markets come and go  and when incentives or net metering rules change, markets can shut down overnight, resulting in a complete write-down of all invested costs, which is a big expense hit. There are huge differences between customer acquisition costs at the big public companies that are driving top-line revenue based on advertising, buying closed deals and highly paid salespeople -- some of those costs are going to be $0.75 to $1.00 a watt  and smaller local companies that have a flat organizational structure and get the majority of their customers from referrals.\" \"I think what's going to happen with the customer acquisition costs is that they're going to start coming down, not because we found a better way to find customers, not because of technology and web funnel sites and direct mail. It's going to change because the business model in the solar industry is going to evolve more toward local installers who, by necessity and inherently, have lower customer acquisition costs.\"  Cinnamon sets engineering and permitting costs at about $0.09 a watt. \"I used to have a room full of engineers and project managers, and their entire job was to take the sketch from the salesperson, who would usually go up on a ladder with graph paper and sketch it out and then turn it into a drawing, and then try to get approval from the customer that the design is OK, then get the building permit. And the cost per job, when I looked at my overhead for all those people and how many permits they actually got, it was astounding. It was like, way over $1,000, sometimes $1,500, sometimes $2,000, because these permits would take time, they go back and forth, and take multiple revisions.\" Cinnamon said he saw a lot of benefits come out of the DOE SunShot program, particularly in the field of software that helps installers with design and permitting. He noted that a company he worked with, Greenlancer, had a web-based form that allowed an installer to \"submit a picture of where the solar is going to go on the roof, it's usually a satellite photo, there'd be a sketch of where the modules are. You put some parameters about the job, the modules, the racking, the inverters, the customer's name, boom, boom, boom. In two days, they send back a permit, less than $250, almost always perfect. If there's a change, they make it for free. So there are some areas in the solar business, residential and commercial, where outsourcing is absolutely terrific, and this is one of them.\" When we look at the root cause of these high overhead costs, most of these costs are policy-related. Compared to other countries, such as Germany, in the U.S. there are many more regulations that apply to a simple rooftop solar installation: local permitting requirements, utility regulations, incentive applications, insurance, labor rules, financing costs, etc. The SunShot program tried to fix these policy problems with technology, and that for the most part didnt work. President Trump is on to something when he wants to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome regulations. \"In my experience going back to 2001, the most common cause of a customer service call, without a doubt, talk to any installer, is a problem with the monitoring. The system is still working. The inverters are still working. That green light is on on the SMA inverter. All the Enphase inverters are working. But the monitoring is not working. Enphase just wasn't able to really solve that monitoring problem as well as SolarEdge was. I think the reason is Enphase used powerline communication over an AC line  which is noisy. And then they'd use the home's internet connection to transmit the data. SolarEdge took a different approach. They communicate to the optimizers on the back of every module though the DC wiring so there's less noise, and then use cellular communications to their server.\" \"So in 2021, let's just assume that it's $2.50 a watt, as long as we put the system in before the end of the year, so you're looking at 5 cents a kilowatt-hour, maybe a bit more if the customer does not have a 25 year inverter warranty.\" The question now becomes, \"Where can you have a profitable business model when the selling price of the system is $2.50 a watt and electricity is 5 cents?\"  \"If you look at the HVAC business, it's kind of the same. If you talk to an HVAC company and say, 'I want to put air conditioning in my house,' you're looking at a cost of about $10,000 to $15,000 for the equipment, the duct work, the permitting and everything else. It's the same with solar. That HVAC work is also maybe $5,000 worth of compressors, controllers, air handler, duct work and the rest of the $10,000 is labor. So, I think the solar business is going to start looking a lot like the HVAC business. The other way it is going to start looking like the HVAC business is there is going to be a lot of maintenance involved.\" \"I look at storage as the antidote to the metering caps, unfavorable time-of-use rates, and demand charges. Battery storage with solar is going to preserve the customer economics -- that is what we all expect is going to happen as the battery storage systems get more affordable, and most importantly, when they get fully integrated with reliable inverters, control hardware and software.\" \"I think about the ideal energy appliance that I would like to get in a few years. It would be a box in my garage that I could plug my EV into that also has an inverter on it so I can interact with the grid. And that inverter would be connected to batteries in the garage plus solar panels on the roof. The car batteries and solar panels are all DC, so I'd only need to go to AC when power is sent off the grid or used in my house. Plus, well need an app that can minimize customers energy costs with knowledge of current electric rates, solar and battery charge status, building energy consumption, and perhaps even near future weather conditions. \"I believe the small, efficient installers will crowd out the very big installers if they dont change. There is a lot of potential for strong regional installers that can dominate adjacent local markets. New business models have great potential to reduce costs, such as franchising based on technology and branding, selling solar along with complementary home services, and companies that focus on just one part of the customer experience -- such as financing or installation.\" He added, \"In a few short years a 6,000-kilowatt system is going to cost about $10,000. Slap that amount on a credit card or take it out of savings. 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared to the U.S. average of 13 cents per kilowatt-hour -- and in some states over 25 cents. These low behind-the-meter solar electric rates are what is freaking out the utilities. And short of making it illegal for customers to install rooftop systems -- most likely with storage -- I dont see any future in the conventional utility business model.\"", "theme": "Residential Solar", "title": "Can Residential Installers Make a Profit From Solar Priced at $2.50 per Watt?", "comments": "38", "tags": ["barry cinnamon", "residential solar", "solar costs", "solar pricing", "the long tail"]}
{"body": " About a year ago, First Solar announced that it was making a fundamental change in the architecture of the big solar power plants it builds and operates by moving from a conventional string architecture to a medium-voltage DC (MVDC) scheme. GTM has now learned from several sources that First Solar has indefinitely postponed that transition, and First Solar CTO Raffi Garabedian has confirmed. Garabedian told GTM, \"Weve postponed MVDC indefinitely given the increased competition and margin compression were seeing in central and string inverters. We still believe that the MVDC architecture has a substantial system-level cost entitlement, but were waiting for conventional inverter prices to stabilize before we restart. On the standard inverter front, there are a number of new (or new to us) players [Editor's note: Huawei] in the market who are competing aggressively with high-quality products. We think this situation will remain the norm in the power conversion business for some time.\" At First Solar's analyst day in April of last year, Garabedian called MVDC \"a completely new, radically game-changing power plant architecture for solar.\" He said at the time, \"If you look at a conventional architecture, you've got modules in the field that are connected in what's called strings. Multiple strings of modules are combined in combiner boxes where all of that energy is aggregated in parallel, and fuse-protected, and then sent through feeder lines to power conversion stations. That transmission of energy is done at 1,500 volts today with our 1,500-volt inverter system. More commonly, it's done at 800 or 1,000 volts in the industry,\" he said. \"Each power conversion station is a combination of an inverter and a transformer that steps up the voltage roughly to 35 kilovolts, which goes to a PV combiner switch gear and then onto the substation and onto the grid connection. That's how power plants are built today,\" Garabedian continued. MVDC would change \"the number of elements in this power plant, reducing the number of parts and improving the capacity factor of the energy generation of the plant. By replacing the combiner boxes here with DC-to-DC converters that step up the voltage from the strings to roughly 10x the string voltage of 1,500 volts, we can dramatically improve the cost of wiring and the resistive losses in the wiring, and by using a very large-scale DC-to-AC converter, which is commonly available in the utility industry (used for grid ties globally), and by leveraging that pre-existing technology, we can achieve a very good cost structure from the MVDC point forward to the grid connection,\" according to the CTO. MVDC could \"also bring to bear grid control and support functions that are already available in these large-scale DC-to-AC converters, which are not available in standard PV inverter systems.\"  \"What are the advantages? We can reduce the number of components in the field. We can reduce the amount of labor in the field, and we can reduce the energy losses in the power conversion systems.\" According to Garabedian, \"It doesn't stop there. There's one more benefit. This system is storage-ready. What that means is that we are architecting the system to accept battery storage systems integration into the DC side of the plant.\" But those benefits will have to wait until inverter prices stabilize. MJ Shiao, GTM's director of solar research, summed up the MVDC approach as a \"super-centralized\" model with a very large medium-voltage DC-to-AC converter creating \"a 100-megawatt power conversion station.\" Shiao identifies all the benefits of raising DC voltages: \"Less wiring, less trenching, eliminating combiner boxes (although you replace that with the DC-DC optimizer), fixed voltage output that reduces the DC-AC conversion complexity, reduced DC losses, reduced site grading/civil work, etc.\" But he also had some concerns: \"MVDC means a whole new ball game for construction and O&M. There's not much solar-specific equipment beyond the DC-DC optimizers in this case, but anything that's not off-the-shelf needs to be certified by UL, etc., and that could take a while.\" Shiao pointed out that the architecture isn't totally brand new. Alencon, with funding from the DOE and backing from Stephens Capital Partners, has been working on this type of architecture, albeit with a 2,500 VDC bus. Shiao suggests that SunPower is working on something along these lines (based on the DragonFly acquisition), while Ampt has also been pushing string-level DC optimization in the utility space for the past few years.  Scott Moskowitz, GTM Research solar analyst, notes, \"This is exponentially more ambitious than [the move to] 1,500 volts,\" with \"far more significant hurdles.\" Shifting to 1,500 volts only required small changes in supply chains, some R&D to reconfigure and test products, incremental changes to standards for PV components, and there was precedent from the earlier evolution to 1,000 volts. Medium-voltage DC would require significantly more technology development and would require borrowing conversion technologies from other energy industries.\" In 2015, former First Solar CEO Jim Hughes said, \"The large arrays that are built today are essentially a scaled-up rooftop system -- because it's what the code authorities in ancient years [understood]. If you were building a large-scale array from scratch on a clean sheet of paper with no prior contamination, what you would build would look different than what we build today.\" \"I think over the next five years, you'll see the industry transition to a fundamentally different architecture with greater use of DC bus [and] use of AC conversion at higher voltages with fewer inverters. [...] I also think we need tighter integration with the [way we] use electricity.\" He said there is an opportunity to do things on the DC side, as well. \"If you can co-locate or locate within in a reasonable distance, you can put DC right into the data center,\" resulting in \"a 15 percent cost savings from avoiding the whole AC conversion side of the equation,\" Hughes said. Again, those benefits will have to wait until inverter prices stabilize. Garabedian notes, \"A similar situation exists in the structure realm, where weve seen new suppliers entering the market with well-engineered and locally cost-optimized solutions. Rather than try to be the best at everything everywhere, were taking advantage of this dynamic through an ecosystem initiative whereby were working closely with trusted structure suppliers to assure low-cost compatible and reliable 'First Solar-ready' structures.\"", "theme": "BOS/Inverters", "title": "First Solar Postpones Its Move to a Medium-Voltage DC Utility Solar Architecture", "comments": "11", "tags": ["first solar", "mvdc", "raffi garabedian"]}
{"body": " In its biggest year to date, the United States solar market nearly doubled its annual record, topping out at 14,626 megawatts of solar PV installed in 2016. This represents a 95 percent increase over the previous record of 7,493 megawatts installed in 2015. GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) previewed this data in advance of their upcoming U.S. Solar Market Insight report, set to be released on March 9. FIGURE: U.S. Solar PV Installations, 2010-2016  Source: GTM Research / SEIA U.S. Solar Market Insight report For the first time ever, U.S. solar ranked as the No. 1 source of new electric generating capacity additions on an annual basis. In total, solar accounted for 39 percent of new capacity additions across all fuel types in 2016. What these numbers tell you is that the solar industry is a force to be reckoned with, said Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIAs president and CEO. Solar's economically winning hand is generating strong growth across all market segments nationwide, leading to more than 260,000 Americans now employed in solar. FIGURE: Share of Capacity Additions by Generation Source  Source: GTM Research / SEIA U.S. Solar Market Insight report Success this year was driven largely by the utility-scale segment, which was bolstered by a pipeline of projects initially hedging against the extension of the federal Investment Tax Credit. Not only did it represent the most megawatts installed, but the utility-scale segment also featured the highest growth rate of any segment, growing 145 percent from 2015. \"In a banner year for U.S. solar, a record 22 states each added more than 100 megawatts,\" said Cory Honeyman, GTM Research's associate director of U.S. solar. \"While U.S. solar grew across all segments, what stands out is the double-digit-gigawatt boom in utility-scale solar, primarily due to solar's cost-competitiveness with natural-gas alternatives.\" The non-residential market also exceeded expectations, with two major growth drivers in the segment. The first is community solar, adding a record total of more than 200 megawatts, led by Minnesota and Massachusetts. Second, rate design and net energy metering fueled a rush in project development and installation growth across a number of major state markets, most notably in California.  For the first time since 2011, non-residential installation growth surpassed residential solar growth, which posted a still-impressive 2,583 megawatts. While growth in Californias residential market has begun to level out, strong growth in markets like Maryland, New Jersey and a handful of emerging states where solar has achieved grid parity, helped the residential segment to grow 19 percent year-over-year. As a result of a remarkable 2016, the U.S. is now home to more than 1.3 million solar PV installations, with a cumulative capacity of over 40 gigawatts.

{"body": " In recent months, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has taken several steps toward fully incorporating energy storage in U.S. wholesale energy markets -- which, if successful, could be a major boon for the energy storage industry. These actions reflect the fact that theres an exponential amount of energy storage slated to come on-line, as well as its unique abilities to help in different ways, said Acting FERC Chairman Cheryl LaFleur, speaking this week at the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners winter meeting. Sometimes it [benefits] transmission, sometimes its generation, sometimes it can help with ancillary services, and were proposing to require changes in the wholesale market to reflect that, said the commissioner, who is a Democrat. In November, FERC issued a proposed rulemakingthat would require each regional transmission organization and independent system operator to remove any barriers in their tariff structure that are inhibiting the market participation of storage resources. We wanted them to be able to participate to the full extent of their capabilities, said LaFleur. The same proposal would also allow distributed energy resources, including but not limited to energy storage, to be aggregated and bid directly into organized wholesale markets. The proposal specifies that resources looking to participate at the wholesale level cannot already be receiving payments through the distribution system, such as net metering. Commissioner LaFleur has expressed some concerns over opening up market competition and is viewed by some as morefriendly to traditional market players. And with three seats currently unfilled on the five-member FERC panel, theres uncertainty around how, and how quickly, energy storage and other advanced energy technologies will be recognized at the national level. Several clean energy stakeholders filed comments on Monday urging FERC to allow advanced energy technologies to compete on providing energy and reliability services. The proposed rule was just the first step in opening up energy markets. FERC commissioners still have to decide whether to finalize it -- which will have to wait until the open seats are filled. Regional markets will then have 18 months to change their tariffs, which is a process that goes through FERC review and is also judicially challengeable. These technologies arent new, said Arvin Ganesan, vice president of federal affairs at Advanced Energy Economy. So its not a matter of whether they can technically provide [grid] services, but it becomes a question of whether RTOs will change their tariffs to allow these technologies to compete to provide that service. AEE praised FERC's broader initiative to include energy storage and DERs in the wholesale market, but also requested several changes to the proposed rule in comments filed this week. Among them, AEE wrote that FERC should not restrict aggregated DERs participating in retail compensation programs (i.e., net metering) from also participating in wholesale markets. FERC's proposed solution to the double-payment issue is \"overly broad,\" the advanced energy business association wrote. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI), which represents the electric power industry, also filed comments on the proposed rulemaking this week, expressing support for allowing energy storage resources to participate in wholesale energy markets. But the organization was less enthusiastic about the second part of the proposal. EEI wrote that allowing for DER aggregation to participate in wholesale markets should be addressed at the regional level, and not mandated by FERC, because of the potential impacts on distribution system reliability. LaFleur expressed a similar set of concerns in a statement issued at the time of the proposal. I was very interested in particular on comments on the distributed energy resource proposal, particularly the operational coordination among the RTO andISO control centers, the distribution control centers, the distributed aggregators and the distribution companies, she said yesterday. I understand we got a lot of comments, she said. Well be looking at those very closely to see whether this is ready to go to a final rule or not. The other thing well be closely watching is California, which now has five distributed energy resource aggregators signed up, LaFleur added, referring to Californias decision to open up DERs to wholesale market competition. We are figuring out how they integrate them into their market and can probably learn from that in order to decide how far to go. As DER aggregation stirs debate, the inclusion of energy storage in wholesale markets has not gone unchallenged. In a January policy statement, FERC clarified that energy storage may recover costs through both cost-based and market-based rates -- a move that could make energy storage more competitive. But LaFleur submitted a dissent. I dissented on that order, not because Im not open to specific situations where a specific resource might get two payment streams; I think on a case-by-case basis, I would consider making exceptions, said LaFleur. But I was concerned with some of the broader language and policy statements about the potential impacts on wholesale markets of having other payment streams. I thought it came awfully close to implicating some of the questions we have pending before us now with respect to state policy initiatives and how theyll be valued in wholesale markets, which I know we will be looking at going forward, she said. While she didnt elaborate, LaFleur was likely referring to the November proposed rulemaking and the restrictions on double payments placed on DERs. Despite LaFleurs concerns, FERC has signaled that it is taking the removal of discriminatory barriers to participation in the wholesale markets very seriously. For instance, FERC is currently accepting comments on a December 2016 proposal rulemaking that could make the interconnection of energy storage resources more efficient, according to LaFleur. FERC also ruled favorably last week on an energy storage complaint between the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Indianapolis Power & Light (IPL), ordering MISO to allow for a battery storage project owned by IPL to participate in wholesale markets -- even though the broader energy storage proposal has yet to be finalized. While FERC is gridlocked waiting for new presidential appointees, Ganesan said he has a positive outlook on wholesale market reform going forward based on LaFleur's record and recent comments. Weve met with Chairman LaFleur, and shes pro-technology. She is [in favor of] getting an implementation process down that makes sense,\" he said. For LaFleur, the regulatory structure for energy storage that may ultimately make the most sense is to treat it independently of other electricity categories, not as a part of each of them. Almost everyone believes well have more storage and distributed energy resources in the future than we do now, but I at least think we dont fully understand yet in the long run how it will be treated, said LaFleur. If [energy storage] develops to the extent that we think it might be developing, it will just be its own thing -- electricity is generation, transmission, distribution and storage, rather than fitting it into the others, but that will play itself out as we move forward technologically.", "theme": "Energy Storage", "title": "Wholesale Market Changes Will Reflect the Unique Abilities of Energy Storage, Says FERCs LaFleur", "comments": "13", "tags": ["cheryl lafleur", "der aggregation", "energy storage", "ferc", "naruc", "net metering", "wholesale markets"]}

The firm announced its financial results yesterday afternoon for the quarter ending December 31, and although SolarEdge reported top and bottom lines below Street expectations, the solar electronics firm managed to post a strong gross margin of 33 percent. Last quarter, GTM Research analyst Scott Moskowitz noted SolarEdge \"overachieved on margin,\" hitting 32.6 percent versus a guidance of 30 percent to 32 percent.  A research note from Oppenheimer explains that \"the big test for [SolarEdge] will begin later in CY17 as the impact of China-based competition is clearer and could be offset by market share gains from fading EU players. We see the potential for material operating leverage in 2018, but believe it is too early to tell whether that will play out.\" The analyst adds, \"We are encouraged to see SEDG picking up share in Australia, Japan, and Europe,\" GTM Research's Moskowitz was ready for that \"China-based competition\" remark. He counters, \"Analysts have displayed something of an obsession with the upcoming release of a module-level product electronics device from Huawei, though GTM believes that product will not have significant impact until 2018. Either way, healthy margins are a good sign for SolarEdge -- the company must remain sharply focused on cost reduction if it hopes to maintain its market leadership over the long term. More significant is the rapid decline of inverter ASPs and the threat of new entrants. Inverter prices fell aggressively across all market segments in 2016, and there will not be respite in 2017.\" \"We continued our cost-reduction measures, yielding solid operating income and record gross margin despite lower revenues than in previous quarters, said Guy Sella, founder, chairman and CEO of SolarEdge. We remain confident in our ability to grow revenues and profitability in 2017. Oppenheimer notes, \"We note market dynamics are shifting quickly and believe MarQ17 guidance is reflective of solid channel inventory management.\" Moskowitz sums it up: \"SolarEdge continues to lead the global residential PV inverter market. However, growth in the U.S. residential market slowed significantly in 2016, and the challenges that caused the slowdown remain in 2017. Adoption of the 2014 version of the National Electrical Code in California this January will be a significant catalyst for SolarEdge, as well as for Enphase Energy, and should make up for the weakness in demand.\" FIGURE:U.S. Utility PV Fixed-Tilt Turnkey EPC System Pricing, H1 2016-2021E ($/Wdc)  Source:U.S. PV System Pricing H2 2016", "theme": "BOS/Inverters", "title": "SolarEdge Grows PV Inverter Margin in Volatile Market", "comments": "0", "tags": ["enphase", "huawei", "inverters", "mlpe", "solaredge"]}
{"body": " Climatescope, a new report from BNEF, was released last week, and while many news outlets highlighted the finding that solar is now cheaper than wind,the report contains numbers that signal another major shift in renewable energy. The report focuses on \"clean energy market conditions and opportunities in 58 emerging nations in South America, Africa, the Mideast, and Asia\" and contrasts the progress of these poorer nationsagainst the achievements of the OECD countries -- the wealthier nations of the world that are members of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development. And for the first time, the developing nations are winning. The 58 emerging-market economies aggregated in the Climatescope report set a record for clean energy deployed in 2015 with 70 gigawatts built, compared to the 59 gigawatts of clean power deployed in the 35 wealthier OECD countries. Cumulatively, the developing nations have won $154.1 billion in cleantech investment and added more clean energy capacity, with faster growth rates than the OECD nations using both those metrics. According to the report, 80 percent of the developing nations studied now have national clean energy targets, while three in four have set CO2 emissions reduction goals. China played a big part in this, but \"less-developed nations also played a role.\" There is a downside to record rates of renewables being added to existing grids, and that's integration challenges. The report notes that some nations have built wind or solar projects despite not having the \"associated transmission to deliver power\" along with \"grid operators [prioritizing] delivery\" of power from fossil-fuel plants over those from renewable sources.  Fixed-tilt utility-scale solar system costs in the U.S. are approaching $1.00 per watt, according to GTM Research. This same price decline is happening across the globe.  The chart below shows the average cost of new wind and solar from 58 emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil. And while solar costs have been plummeting, the solar-wind cost crossover has occurred sooner than expected or predicted. According to the report, in 2016, \"Its likely that the total amount of solar photovoltaics added globally will exceed that of wind for the first time.\" The latest BNEF forecasts expect 70 gigawatts of newly installed solar in 2016 compared with 59 gigawatts of wind. Ethan Zindler, head of U.S. policy analysis at BNEF, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying, A huge part of this story is China, which has been rapidly deploying solar and helping other countries finance their own projects.

{"body": " Ambri, with its liquid metal battery technology, has returned to the energy storage race after \"a pause\" during which it redesigned its high-temperature seals and worked on other facets of its storage system. Getting an entirely new and novel battery chemistry to commercial scale is Sisyphean work. About a year ago, the firm had to lay off approximately 25 percent of its staff because the startup had \"not made the technology progress [it] had anticipated.\" The CEO said at the time, \"Bringing new scientific discoveries in the physical sciences to commercial success is hard; the process is not entirely knowable or amenable to predictable timelines.\" Ambri had been working on prototype storage systems with project partners such as Hawaiian Electric and Con Edison. The now 37-employee company just announced that it's still going after the potentially immense stationary energy storage market, but with an improved version of its unique battery. Ambri's technology is based on the research of Donald Sadoway, MIT professor of materials chemistry, and inspired by the economies of scale facilitated by modern electrometallurgy and the aluminum smelter. The big-battery startup has raised more than $50 million in venture capital from investors KLP Enterprises, the family office of Karen Pritzker and Michael Vlock, Building Insurance Bern, Khosla Ventures, Bill Gates and French energy giant Total. Over the last year, the firm kept busy redesigning high-temperature seals and developing its battery management system and heater control. Ambri has been testing a \"fully functioning in-lab\" energy storage system, which provides 20 kilowatt-hours of energy storage with a peak capacity of 6 kilowatts. A spokesperson for the company said, \"We will be building a commercial Ambri system in our lab next year which will be more than 500 kilowatt-hours in capacity. We will deploy our first systems of this size with customers in 2018.\" Although Ambri claims the battery can be used for frequency regulation, it is a \"long-duration\" energy storage technology that boasts \"no fade rate\" on \"full depth of discharge cycling over thousands of cycles and years of operation. According to the firm, the three battery layers in the Ambri device are self-segregating, cheap to manufacture and earth-abundant. The materials used in the original design were magnesium and antimony separated by a salt, but the Sadoway team has ongoing research on other elemental combinations. It recently demonstrated that calcium can make up parts of the three-part liquid metal battery. An article in Nature suggests that Sadoway has worked with a lithium-antimony-lead materials system, as well. DavidSnydacker, a battery scientist at Dosima Research, notes that \"Sadoways claims of durability obscured a core tenet of battery diligence: Cycle life and calendar life are not the same.\" He adds, \"When batteries are tested in the lab, they are often cycled 12 times per day. This allows researchers to achieve 1,000 cycles in just a few months. Researchers are often tempted to extrapolate this cycle life to predict a lifespan. For example, if a battery maintains 90 percent of its capacity after 1,000 cycles, then it should maintain 70 percent of its capacity after 3,000 cycles. And if the battery is used just once per day, then 3,000 cycles should last nearly 10 years, right? Wrong.\" \"When a battery is operated for years, many aging mechanisms appear that may be hidden during first months of testing. All batteries contain reactive materials, which can degrade the battery over time, and this degradation is accelerated by high temperature. Ambris very high temperature allows it to use molten electrodes but presents a variety of problems related to calendar life.\" Ambri investor Vinod Khosla is not a big fan of lithium-ion batteries and has funded a number of energy storage companies including Pellion, LightSail, QuantumScapeand Seeo. There are a number of other companies developing lithium-ion alternatives. Aquion, funded by KPCB, ATV and Foundation Capital, is developing a saltwater electrolyte-based system. Eos has a zinc-air battery with some customer traction. In 2014, Alevo unstealthed with claims of a new sulfur-based inorganic lithium-ion electrolyte chemistry. Stanford University technology can be found in Huggins Group battery startup Alveo Energy. Fluidic Energy is deploying zinc-air batteries. Dozens more startups are aiming for utility-scale energy storage working with compressed air, mechanical systems, flow batteries, and other electrochemical means. Here's a batch of European energy storage startups. There is a load of VC investment thinly spread in this field -- and a familiar, dismal reckoning awaits. In the meantime, Ambri has to work on performance, lifetime, safety and thermal issues while maintaining the liquid state of the metals, and coping with corrosion and the slow pace of new-technology uptake by utilities.  *** Back in 2014 we reported on a presentation given by Ambri's David Bradwell at Infocast's Energy Storage Week. Here it is.   Prototype units started as the \"shot glass,\" followed by the 3-inch, 20-watt-hour \"hockey puck,\" and then by the 6-inch, 200-watt-hour \"saucer.\" The commercialized product will use a 6-inch square.   Bradwell notes that the batteries achieve 1,000 cycles of continuous deep cycling with negligible fade. There are no moving parts, pumps or valves in the design.   The cell is contained in a 4-inch-by-4-inch stamped stainless steel housing with no nanoscale microstructures or difficult-to-synthesize materials, according to the co-founder.    The cells have a DC-to-DC efficiency of 80 percent at a five-hour charge/discharge rate and an AC-to-AC efficiency of 70 percent to 75 percent.   Bradwell noted that all manufacturing processes and robotic cell assembly had to be developed by Ambri. He claims that the technology has a lower manufacturing cost and lower employee-per-square-foot-of-factory ratio than that of lithium-ion battery technology. The CTO also suggested that Ambri's pricing will fall between that of pumped hydro and compressed-air energy storage.

{"body": " Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been selected to be an economic adviser to President-elect Donald Trump. Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, and Indra Nooyi, chairwoman and CEO of PepsiCo, were also picked to join the policy team. Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, announced earlier this month, now comprises 19 industry leaders, including General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger, JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon and Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon. Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of the investment firm Blackstone, will serve as the forum chair. America has the most innovative and vibrant companies in the world, and the pioneering CEOs joining this forum today are at the top of their fields, Trump said in a statement announcing Musk and the other new team members. My administration is going to work together with the private sector to improve the business climate and make it attractive for firms to create new jobs across the United States, from Silicon Valley to the heartland. Several companies represented at the forum are active participants in the clean energy sector as major renewable energy purchasers, or through the cleantech products and services they offer, or both. On Wednesday, Trump and his team met with the heads of leading tech companies, several of which have committed to powering 100 percent of their operations with renewable energy, including Google, Apple and Facebook. Tesla, however, boasts the most impeccable cleantech credentials among them. Musk built the electric vehicle (EV) company to address carbon emissions as part of its core mission. In his \"Master Plan, Part Deux,\" Musk wrote that \"we must at some point achieve a sustainable energy economy or we will run out of fossil fuels to burn and civilization will collapse.\" Spearheading the green economy with a set of widely compelling products has been one of Musk's central aims. Over the past year and a half, as the presidential campaigns raged, Tesla evolved from an EV maker into a multifaceted sustainable energy company with the launch of Tesla's battery business and the recent acquisition of the SolarCity, the nation's leading rooftop solar installer. Musk said little about his political views during the election, although he donated to Hillary Clinton's campaign and eventually expressed doubts about Trump and his pro-fossil-fuel platform. In a November 4 interview with CNBC, Musk said, \"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy.\" Now that Trump has been elected and Musk has his ear, what will the cleantech champion say? It's unclear exactly what Musk and other industry leaders have discussed with Trump so far, but many Americans are hoping that climate change is somewhere on the agenda. Trump has called climate change a hoax and continues to doubt the science, which has created concern for environmentalists, clean energy groups and other countries that have vowed to take climate action. In hopes of changing Trump's view, more than 10,000 people signed a Change.org petition asking Musk to give the president-elect a climate change lecture. In his new advisory role, it's possible something like that could happen. Musk wasn't brought on to talk about climate science, though. Because the Strategic and Policy forum is intended to focus on economic issues, discussions are likely to center on specific policy actions the federal government can take to grow businesses and create jobs. To that end, Musk could go to bat for the continuation of federal incentives for renewables. Last December, Congress passed a bipartisan bill extending the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind through 2020. With support from both parties, it's unlikely the credits will be repealed before they're scheduled to sunset, but not impossible. Depending on Trump's priorities, the incentives could be cut early as part of a larger tax plan backed by Republicans in Congress. Musk, whose businesses benefit directly from the ITC, could help keep renewable energy tax credits off the chopping block. EV credits are another policy issue Musk could take on. Given Trump's views on climate, cleantech advocates are concerned he will ease fuel economy regulations on automakers and pressure California to abandon its zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which could further dampen the overall EV market. Musk's views on ZEV are murky. Last quarter, Tesla made $139 million from selling ZEV credits to other automakers. Yet Musk has said that eliminating the program would actually make Tesla more competitive, because an oversupply of credits has reduced the potential to earn money from them. \"The incentives either dont scale or are disadvantageous,\" Musk said on a recent earnings call, when asked if a Trump presidency would hurt his EV business. While he downplayed the significance, it's in Musk's interest to defend clean-vehicle mandates as long as Tesla can benefit from them, and it's in the interest of reducing emissions that they remain in place. It would also be advantageous for Tesla to have Trump promote extending the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs. Currently, the credit is set to phase out once an automaker sells 200,000 EV units. Because of that limit, most people who have preordered a Tesla Model 3 won't get the tax break. The Trump administration is not a fan of handouts, but Musk could make a compelling case for extending the $7,500 EV credit based on cutting foreign oil dependence. Then again, with strong pro-oil views among many of Trump's top agency picks and Republicans in Congress, that attempt may be futile. Where Musk could be most effective as a Trump adviser is in advocating for continued investments in cleantech research and development at the Department of Energy. Among many other things, the DOE has played an instrumental role in bringing down the cost of lithium-ion batteries and helping to develop the next generation of battery technologies. Companies like Tesla stand to benefit from government-led innovation and government-trained talent pool. However, it's unclear what kind of policy advice Musk's \"go-it-alone\" attitude will translate into. Tesla's leadership frequently touts the company's abilities, like cutting battery costs faster than projections. So it's possible that Musk will argue that entrepreneurship is the true source of innovation, not the state. Also, while Tesla benefited from a $465 million DOE loan, Musk has played down its significance. After the loan was paid off (nine years early), Musk said that a carbon tax would be better than a government loan program. \"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution,\" he tweeted. If Musk could actually convince Trump to propose a carbon tax, that would come as a shock and a delight to many, but that seems unlikely. On the other hand, if Musk decided not to advocate for DOE's cleantech investments because he thinks they've had a limited impact on Tesla's success, that seems shortsighted. According to an internal memo sent to the DOE by Trump's transition team, the new administration plans to take a close look at the government's loan programs. While Republicans frequently point to Solyndra's failure -- Trump himself called it a \"disaster\" -- the loan program has a loss ratio of just 2.33 percent and has been instrumental in making clean energy solutions more competitive. Many energy and technology experts view continued investments through the DOE loan office and through other vehicles like ARPA-E as critical to advancing the clean energy sector and boosting U.S. economic competitiveness overall. On this issue, the cleantech community is surely looking to Musk as an ally. Of course, even if Musk tells Trump that leading on climate and clean energy is in America's best interest, there's a chance the next president just won't listen. At the end of the day, Musk holds an advisory role. Meanwhile, Trump has given top positions in his administration to people with strong ties to traditional energy industries. \"We want you to keep going with the incredible innovation,\" Trump told Musk and other tech leaders on Wednesday, according to Newsweek.

{"body": " InsideClimate News:Climate Denial Rides Trump's Coattails to a Roaring Comeback As the nation heads toward a Donald Trump presidency, environmental advocates and their political allies are grappling with a presence set to loom large in the nation's policymaking. It's a set of viewpoints that had been teetering on the edge of irrelevance under President Obama: the resurgent climate denial movement. Over the last month, that viewpoint not only rushed back into the mainstream, but it now threatens to dominate Trump's cabinet. He has filled his transition team and top energy and environment posts (among others) with a litany of climate science denialists who oppose government action on global warming, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry (Department of Energy), Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt (Environmental Protection Agency), and Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke (Department of Interior). The Washington Post:The U.S. Solar Industry Is Booming -- and It Isnt Afraid of Trump The U.S. solar industry experienced its biggest boom yet this year, with a record-breaking 4,143 megawatts (or million watts) of solar generating capacity added in the third quarter of 2016, according to a new report. And the fourth quarter is on track to surpass it, with continued growth expected through the rest of the decade. The optimistic new report, published by the Solar Energy Industries Association and market analysis firm GTM Research, comes at a time of mounting uncertainty for the future of renewable energy and environmental policy in the United States. President-elect Donald Trump has recently sparked major concern about among environmentalists with his nominations for heads of the federal energy and environment agencies.

{"body": " As the inauguration of President Donald Trump approaches, the future of federal action on energy and climate change remains highly uncertain. And while nothing is set in stone, there is mounting evidence that the new administration will drastically change course from the path set out by President Obama. Among the most recent news: While no outcome is preordained, it is probably safe to assume that the U.S. will not take significant federal action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the next four years. And it is possible that the federal government will begin to roll back many of the R&D and investment programs that have supported the recent domestic boom in clean energy. Initiatives already underway in a few states may act as a limited countervailing force, but the absence of federal action will be strongly felt. If the federal government steps back, the private sector may leap forward. The U.S. business community has already become an increasingly emphatic voice in the chorus of calls for greater action on climate change. Just after the U.S. election, during the Marrakech climate talks, over 300 businesses signed an open letter to the incoming president in support of the Paris climate accord and continuation of low-carbon policies. Ninety-one of these companies have annual revenue over $100 million, including DuPont, General Mills and Intel Corporation.  Corporate America is doing more than just signing letters. Twenty-two of the Fortune 100 companies have committed to procuring 100 percent of their energy from renewables, and 71 have a public target for sustainability or renewable energy. Corporations are already on par with utilities as the largest source of demand for new renewable energy. Large companies have contracted for 6 gigawattsof new utility-scale solar and wind projects since 2014. More than half of new wind power contracts signed in 2015 came from non-utility buyers. Two groups of companies stand out among those who have signed the so-called RE100 pledge. The first is the early adopters including Google, which recently announced it will be the first to reach 100 percentin 2017. These companies have paved the way for others, both because of their public commitment and because they have surmounted complex regulatory, financial and technical hurdles to make these purchases. Googles 100 percent renewable white paper lays out its strategy in detail for all other corporates to see and will likely act as a roadmap for others seeking to follow suit. The second notable group is the manufacturing stalwarts -- companies that may be viewed as less progressive and more risk-averse than their Silicon Valley counterparts. While the Google cohorts path-clearing innovation will yield the biggest short-term impact, these other companies may ultimately drive a broader long-term private-sector commitment. This group includes Coca-Cola Enterprises, General Motors, Johnson & Johnson and Proctor & Gamble. Meanwhile, retailers have taken action in the form of rooftop solar. Target, Wal-Mart and Costco represent three of the top five customers for on-site commercial solar in the country. As part of their transition to renewables, some corporations are forcing utilities to rethink their relationships with their largest customers. In fully regulated electricity markets, customers generally do not have the option to choose their specific source of electricity, but they can pressure their utilities to support their wishes. According to the World Resources Institute, 10 U.S. utilities in eight states have created such green tariff options for large customers, double the number at the end of 2015. In an even more dramatic turn, MGM Resorts defected from its incumbent utility, NV Energy, to purchase its power directly from the wholesale market, partially in order to aggressively [pursue] renewable energy sources. Since then, four more casinos have done the same. Large corporations of all shapes wield influence over the energy supply mix with the scale of their purchases, but energy producers and distributors have their hands directly on the dials. And they too are increasingly committed to reducing carbon emissions. ExxonMobil Corp., whose CEO is slated to be President Trumps Secretary of State nominee, stated continued support for the Paris climate accord in the wake of the U.S. election. Other fossil fuel majors have voiced similar support, though their aggregate investment in renewables thus far remains less than 2 percentof their total capital expenditure. Utility companies may be the linchpin of corporate transformation in the U.S. electricity sector. According to GTM Research, 23 percent of all large-scale solar installed in the U.S. in 2016 was procured voluntarily by utilities, in the absence of any federal or state mandate. Six of the top 10 owners of grid-scale solar in the U.S. are affiliates of utilities, including Southern Power (Southern Company), NextEra Energy Resources (Florida Power & Light), and MidAmerican Energy Holdings (NV Energy, PacifiCorp). American Electric Power (AEP), a coal-heavy Ohio electric utility, told the The Wall Street Journal: Part of our plan to invest in renewables is to diversify our generation portfolio. All of those investments dont change with a change in administration; its a long-term strategy. Utilities will need to go beyond renewable procurement and construction. As more renewable energy enters the electricity grid, utilities and grid operators will determine how to integrate these resources reliably, efficiently and cost-effectively. Here, too, many companies are taking a proactive approach. Among the myriad solutions being tested and rolled out by utilities are battery storage, intelligent solar inverters, new electricity rate designs, and advanced utility analytics and controls. To the extent that the private sector is actively promoting clean energy, it is doing so largely out of its own self-interest. This is fundamental to the staying power of this nascent trend; if you want companies to invest in new technologies, make sure they make good business sense. The two main drivers of corporations can be summed up as risk and return. Risk: The effects of climate change pose a real long-term economic risk to U.S. corporations and the domestic economy. The best estimates of this risk come from Risky Business, an initiative founded in 2013 by former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and philanthropist and climate activist Tom Steyer. The organizations landmark reportquantifies this risk across areas ranging from coastal property and infrastructure to crop yields and labor productivity. The results are sobering, and companies have begun to pay attention. Most large U.S. corporations have an international presence, which also means a global stakeholder base that is largely supportive of climate change mitigation. And for global organizations, climate risk may be greatest abroad. According to Verisk Maplecroft, 18 of the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change lie in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Public companies have been forced to examine this risk themselves since 2010, when the SEC issued disclosure guidance stating that climate-change-related risk must be publicly disclosed when present. Many companies now disclose such risk as a matter of routine.  Return:Perhaps more important than the acknowledgement of climate change-related risk is the fact that, for an increasing number of companies, investment in clean energy is profitable. Cost declines for renewable energy, combined with policy support, have made those resources cheaper than standard electricity in wide swaths of the country. According to a recent series of studies from University of Texas at Austin which incorporates both direct and indirect costs, zero-carbon electricity sources (wind, solar and nuclear) are the lowest-cost source of electricity generation of 64 percent of U.S. counties. Natural gas is the cheapest in the remaining 36 percent of counties. Companies produce two direct economic benefits from most purchases of renewable power. First, they are generally able to achieve immediate electricity cost savings, which reduces their operating expenses and improves cash flow. Second, they typically sign long-term, fixed-price contracts which act as a hedge against fossil fuel and wholesale electricity price volatility. And the cost of renewable energy is poised for further decline. GTM Research estimates that the average all-in cost of a utility-scale solar project will hit $0.98/watt in 2018, down 29 percent from the beginning of 2016 and surpassing the Department of Energys $1.00/watt target two years ahead of schedule. These continued cost reductions may be necessary to support demand if natural-gas prices remain depressed, but if gas prices rise, renewables stand to be the primary beneficiary. For all its might, the private sector cannot entirely overcome inaction at the federal level. But if current trends continue, corporate activity could matter in three ways. Emissions reductions:According to the recent White House deep decarbonization study, the commercial and industrial sectors represent 46 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. And that doesnt include their indirect impact on emissions from the other two major sectors: transportation (34 percent) and residential buildings (20 percent). So any significant action from the private sector can make a real dent in overall emissions, though deep cuts would have to rely on more than just changes to the commercial electricity mix. Renewable energy demand:If the Trump administration deals a death blow to the Clean Power Plan, the U.S. will lose a long-term driver of growth for clean energy. The CPP was unlikely to impact near-term market prospects regardless, since the first targets were set for 2023 and early action credits for 2020-2021, but the program would have forced every state to examine its power sector mix and develop strategies for decarbonization. In the absence of that long-term driver, corporate procurement may provide a new source of growth for wind and solar. The 6 gigawatts of corporate procurement to date is dwarfed by total electricity consumption from the private sector, which could support around 500 gigawatts of renewable energy to meet its entire electricity demand. And thanks to organizations like the Business Renewables Center, it is becoming easier each day for corporates to dip their toes in the water. If a meaningful share of large electricity customers join this trend, renewable energy will have a huge platform from which to expand. International Impact:U.S. participation was key to the success of the Paris climate accord, the biggest international action on climate change since the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. A reversal in the U.S., which is responsible for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, risks a global ripple effect in which other major emitters step back from their own commitments. Already, China and India have warned the incoming administration against reneging. Although there is no indication yet that these countries will rescind their own commitments, each new federal action (or inaction) will create fresh risk. Serious commitment from the private sector can mitigate that threat. By signaling to the global community that the primary driver of the U.S. economy remains committed to decarbonization, with or without federal action, the private sector can take on a state-like role in international climate discussing over the next four years. Corporate action cannot entirely make up for intransigence at the federal level, but it may just be enough to allow the global decarbonization trend to continue apace. *** Shayle Kann is the head of GTM Research and senior vice president at Greentech Media, a Wood Mackenzie Business.A version of this post also appeared on the Council on Foreign Relations' \"Energy, Security, and Climate\" blog.", "theme": "Policy", "title": "The Private Sector May Lead the Charge Against Climate Change During the Trump Administration", "comments": "26", "tags": ["business", "climate action", "climate change", "corporate renewables procurement", "donald trump"]}

It will be a symbolic moment for the company -- after all, it was at the same event last year that Faraday was lambasted for unveiling an overhyped concept car -- and the hype has been commensurate. Over the past few weeks, Faraday has been aggressively teasing the car with a steady stream of mysterious tweets and short videos of a camouflaged prototype speeding through a desert. But six former Faraday employees told BuzzFeed News the company is headed toward its big CES reveal following a year fraught with financial troubles, including mounting unpaid bills, lawsuits from a supplier and a landlord, and a distracting side project undertaken at the behest of its largest investor. The past year has also seen a slew of departures, including senior staffers. Month to month, the money was never there. Funds were lower than what Faraday needed to cover operational costs and commitments to suppliers, one former employee with knowledge of the companys finances told BuzzFeed News. Like most of the people interviewed for this story, the source spoke to BuzzFeed News on the condition of anonymity. U.S. News & World Report: An Oil Man in Washington It can be easy to spot the ExxonMobil employees at industry meetings. \"Conservatively dressed, hairstyles that seemed influenced by military rules, cliquish, secretive, and businesslike,\" Steve Coll, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and staff writer for The New Yorker, writes in his 2012 book on ExxonMobil, Private Empire. \"Executives at other oil companies tended to regard their Exxon counterparts as ruthless, self-isolating, and inscrutable, but also as priggish Presbyterian deacons.\" That image reflects a deeper culture, one that could often resemble a \"cult,\" Coll says. In the wake of the Exxon Valdez wreck in 1989, which leaked as much as 750,000 barrels of oil into Prince William Sound off Alaska, and the kidnap and murder of executive Sidney Reso in 1992, the corporation sought to standardize -- or \"idiot-proof,\" as Coll puts it -- every conceivable action or interaction by its employees, both at work and at home. That approach apparently appealed to Donald Trump, a president-elect said to value loyalty above all else who named CEO Rex Tillerson his pick for secretary of state on Monday.

{"body": " The Scottish archipelago Orkney is taking steps to adopt a hydrogen-based energy system that feeds off excess tidal generation from the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC). The tidal and wave energy test station is due to install a 500-kilowatt ITM Power polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzer, with integrated compression and up to 500 kilos of storage, in the first quarter of 2017, said Lisa MacKenzie, marketing and communications officer. The 1.79 million (USD $2.77 million) electrolyzer, with a generation capacity of 220 kilos of hydrogen per day, will also mop up excess power from a community wind turbine owned by local renewable energy developer Eday Renewable Energy. Later in the first half of the year, EMEC, which is located on the island of Eday in Orkneys North Isles, will install a 75-kilowatt fuel cell from an unspecified vendor at the pier at Kirkwall, the capital of Orkney, on the island of Mainland. The fuel cell is being installed as part of a project called Orkney Surf and Turf, which will use hydrogen generated by the Orkney-based electrolyzer to provide auxiliary power for ferries docking at Kirkwall. It is also part of a wider plan allowing EMEC to gain experience in hydrogen storage that can then be applied to projects elsewhere, particularly in shipping. The vision in the future is to have hydrogen-powered vessels, MacKenzie told GTM. The issue we have is that hydrogen-powered vessels dont exist. Part of the Surf and Turf project is to develop the fuel cell technology to a standard that could be used at sea. At the same time, a separate project, called BIG HIT, will see the local council in Orkney introduce electric vehicles with fuel-cell range extenders that could also run off the hydrogen produced at EMEC. The BIG HIT project includes the installation of a second 1-megawatt electrolyzer on the island of Shapinsay, between Eday and Mainland. The Shapinsay electrolyzer will be powered by a community wind project on the island. EMEC, which is the worlds most prestigious test center for tidal turbine and wave energy technologies, chose to focus on hydrogen after reviewing a number of options for storing energy, initially as a way to get energy back to mainland Britain. The presence of grid-connected pilots from tidal turbine developers such as Nautricity and OpenHydro, along with community wind power and more than 1,000 residential-scale wind and solar plants, means Orkney already produces more renewable energy than it can use. But the island group, which includes 20 inhabited islands, only has two 33-kilovolt subsea cable connections to Thurso on the north Scottish coast, which makes it difficult to export energy when the tidal arrays are working a full capacity. The plan over a year ago was to find a way of storing the excess energy while tides were coming in or going out, and then releasing it to the grid during slack periods. The center needed multi-megawatt-hour storage with a duration of several hours or even days, which ruled out battery systems. Similarly, two other bulk power management technologies, pumped hydro and compressed air energy storage, were not viable on the Orkney archipelago because of geographical constraints. Thats why weve had to look elsewhere, said MacKenzie. In any event, she said: Were not looking to put the power back into the grid anymore. Its no longer all about storage, although the initial driver was to seek to store electricity between tides. Besides being used for transportation, hydrogen from Orkney could be used industrially, for example as a chemical feedstock, food additive or fertilizer ingredient. Orkney could act as a case study for rural environments elsewhere, said MacKenzie. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether other regions will embrace hydrogen as readily as Orkney is. Carlos Garca Buitrn, managing director of the Spanish renewable energy provider Ecovatios, said: Im no expert, but what I can say is that in mobility, at least, hydrogen has always appeared to be the future, but weve seen lithium batteries overtaking it. Few seem to be considering it now in this field.", "theme": "Other Energy", "title": "Orkney Starts Moving Toward a Hydrogen-Based Energy System Using the Wind and Oceans", "comments": "25", "tags": ["hydrogen", "hydrogen economy", "marine energy", "orkney islands", "tidal energy"]}

We havent seen the leading vendors hold share this high since 2010, when solar demand was highly centered in continental Europe, said Senior Solar Analyst and report author Scott Moskowitz. In fact, the top five vendors alone made up more than half of global inverter shipments. FIGURE: Market Share Breakdown of Global Shipments by Vendors Ranked 1-5, 6-10, 11-20, and 20+  Source: The Global Inverter and MLPE Landscape H2 2016 The report, The Global Inverter and MLPE Landscape H2 2016, is a comprehensive analysis of the global inverter market and profiles 31 vendors in the space. Huawei maintained its top position from 2015, shipping 17 percent of the worlds supply of PV inverters in the first half of the year. However, in terms of inverter revenue, SMA was again the leading player. Bankable suppliers are gaining share as low prices continue to drive out competition. Inverter prices in some segments have fallen by 10 percent in just the last six months. Pricing pressure remains a constant, unrelenting reality in the maturing solar inverter market, said Moskowitz. \"Central inverter prices in the U.S. have fallen the most half-over-half due to increased competition from string inverters and proliferation of lower cost, 1,500-volt models. Global PV inverter shipments will reach a record 63.5 gigawatts (AC) in 2016 before declining 5 percent in 2017 due in part to reduced demand in the worlds three largest solar markets: China, The United States and Japan.Despite the shipment drop, inverter revenue will fall by just 1.2 percent in 2017 with gains coming in sales of residential string inverters and module-level power electronics. The long-term outlook is more positive. GTM Research forecasts shipments to surpass 100 gigawatts by 2021, led by China, albeit a declining share.

{"body": " In 2012, fresh off his win in the presidential race, Barack Obama started talking about climate change. Just not in the way his base wanted. If the message is somehow were going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I dont think anybody is going to go for that. I wont go for that, he said in his first press conference after the election. Obama was slammed by the left for his lame comments implying that economic growth and climate action are mutually exclusive. (This was before John Podesta joined the White House and made climate a top-tier issue for the president.) Although very few people realized it, by that point America had proven that cutting carbon emissions didnt have to come at the expense of economic output. In 2006, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the U.S. grew its GDP while also reducing carbon emissions. It happened again in 2015. This year will be the same. From 2000 to 2015, Americas national GDP grew by 30 percent while emissions declined 10 percent.  Meanwhile, carbon emissions are flattening globally. The reasons are complex and often contested. But its clear that a combination of economic restructuring (good and bad), consumer behavior, and fuel switching in the energy and industrial sectors is responsible. According to a new analysis from the Brookings Institution, 33 U.S. states have now decoupled their emissions from economic growth. And the trend is only strengthening. From 2000 and 2014, 33 states plus the District of Columbia increased GDP while lowering carbon pollution. Collectively, these states dropped emissions by 12 percent and grew their economies by 22 percent. As more studies show that dozens of countries around the world are separating growth from emissions, the Brookings experts wanted to look under the hood to see what is driving the trend locally within the U.S. Emissions decoupling has clearly become more frequent amid the ongoing large-scale switch from coal to natural gas -- driven by the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) boom. At the same time, numerous other factors are clearly influencing outcomes, ranging from changes in the structure and growth of the national economy to investment decisions and technology change to land-use change and the availability of clean new energy resources, including renewables, wrote Devashree Saha and Mark Muro, co-authors of the report. Their findings bring license for a modest degree of optimism, said Saha, a senior policy associate with Brookings and lead author of the report, in an interview. Changes are already underway -- and market forces may actually be more important at this juncture, she said. By market forces, she specifically meant natural-gas fuel switching. According to the research, 60 percent of all carbon reductions in the states came from natural gas -- either from retrofitting coal plants to burn gas, or an increase in consumption within the industrial sector. (A 2013 study from CO2 Scorecard suggested that efficiency accounted for two-thirds of the drop in carbon emissions nationwide in 2012, but the study was an outlier.) Its impossible to overestimate the impact of coal replacement, said Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings, in an interview. The upside: Were burning much less coal. Thats good for public health. The downside: We dont know how much this is increasing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide.   The shift to a service economy is also playing a role. And this is also an economic mixed bag. In fact, almost all of the states that experienced the largest shift toward services industries also registered large declines in their carbon emissions during 2000-2014. For example, as Maines service sectors share of real GDP (in millions of chained 2009 dollars) expanded from 75 percent in 2000 to 83 percent in 2014, its carbon emissions declined by 25 percent. Similarly, Delaware, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia all experienced some of the largest relative expansions of their service sectors among states and likewise achieved substantial carbon emissions declines of 20 percent, 17 percent, 15 percent and 15 percent, respectively, wrote Saha and Muro. The upside: Americas service-sector shift will continue to lower emissions intensity. The downside: Almost every service-sector job -- from cashier to truck driver -- is under threat from automation and artificial intelligence. The steady march of technological progress will help states decarbonize while improving output, but that may spell doom for yet another class of workers. So where are renewables in all of this? Theyre playing a surprisingly small role so far. Saha and Muro explain more in the study: Wind and solar generation have yet to register as broad an impact on decoupling as might be expected -- even in the green West. In this regard, while solar and winds share of electricity generation has been on the rise, [their] large-scale growth in some states dates only to the last decade, and so this analysis does not find a strong statistical relationship between states emissions reductions and solar and winds share of power generation. Even with such extraordinary growth rates, solar is still a tiny fraction of most states electricity generation mix. And in Midwestern states with a lot of wind installed, coal power is still a dominant source of electricity -- makingdecarbonization harder. Renewables are becoming more visible though. The question is where more decarbonization is going to come from -- and renewables will come into the foreground then, said Muro in an interview. Assuming that America doesnt ditch the Paris climate deal under President Trump, it will need to do more to lower emissions. The country is currently on pace to drop carbon emissions by 2.1 percent a year -- but it will need to achieve a rate of 3.5 percent a year to meet international targets. There are 20 states that havent even hit the 2 percent decarbonization rate. This research started long before Donald Trump won the presidency. In the weeks since the election, federal energy policy has been thrown into uncertainty -- and it appears that Obamas signature climate plan will be dismantled. The possibility of federal policy chaos troubles Saha and Muro. But their findings do bring some hopeful signs for the coming years. Local factors (not just federal ones) matter a lot to how this happens. Moreover, the trends depicted here suggest that while federal policy reversals could be traumatic, progress on decarbonizing the nations economy will likely continue regardless of Donald Trump, driven by technology advances, market dynamics, and state policy. In other words: Our next president does matter, but the trend toward decarbonization will likely happen with or without his explicit support.", "theme": "Fossil Fuels", "title": "States Are Decoupling Their Emissions From Economic GrowthFederal Policy Be Damned", "comments": "19", "tags": ["brookings institution", "carbon emissions", "decarbonization"]}

{"body": " SolarCity announced Thursday morning that its expanding operations into Florida, \"something weve wanted to announce for a long time, a company blog post read. The decision to launch a residential solar business in the state comes after voters shot down an amendment that would have allowed utilities to put policy restrictions on the Florida solar market. Amendment 1 was defeated despite more than $25 million in backing from large energy companies. Todays announcement was made possible when the citizens of Florida rejected the anti-solar Amendment 1, which would have made it easier for utilities to add fees to make solar more expensive for customers, according to the SolarCity blog. The Amendment was disguised as a pro-solar policy in what amounted to a cynical attempt by solar opponents to slow down solar development in the state. CEO Lyndon Rive said the vote sends a powerful message about the publics support for solar. \"It reinforces to any policymaker or regulator that when you're making the rules, consider that the voters voted for competition and energy choice,\" he said, in an interview with the Orlando Sentinel. SolarCity, now a subsidiary of Tesla Motors, will initially launch operations in the greater Orlando area, serving customers of Duke Energy and the Orlando Utilities Commission. The company plans to expand to additional areas of the state in the coming months. In other states, SolarCitys business is predominantly driven by the sale of home solar leases. Florida, however, does not allow homeowners to buy solar through a third-party agreement like a lease or power-purchase agreement. Current Florida law only permits utilities to sell electricity to consumers. A bipartisan group of solar advocates sought to change the law and foster competition through a referendum, but the initiative failed to make the 2016 ballot. Due to the limitation on third-party ownership, SolarCity has been slow to enter the Florida market. The companys new business will center on cash and loan purchases -- which are making up an increasing portion of the U.S. residential solar market overall. Customers in Florida continue to benefit from retail-rate net metering, a key policy incentive for the rooftop solar industry. Solar customers also benefit from property tax exemptions, thanks to an amendment that passed with 74 percent approval in August. Amendment 4 specifically authorizes the Florida legislature to exempt solar projects on commercial and industrial properties from both the tangible personal property tax and the ad valorem real estate taxes. On Thursday, State Senator Jeff Brandes filed legislation to formally implement Amendment 4. The Republican senator said he believes the bill will serve as a catalyst for the broader adoption of solar in the state. The voters of Florida spoke loud and clear that they expect the Sunshine State to make the expansion of solar and renewable energy a priority, said Brandes in a statement. I have been committed to diversifying our energy portfolio, and I am excited about the opportunity to bring further investment in solar and renewable energy production.

{"body": " The burgeoning off-grid solar market is expected to be worth more than $3 billion in the coming years, with activity centered in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. But the need for access to electricity is also acute in Latin America, where an estimated 22 million people live without modern energy services. Haiti has the largest population living in energy poverty, more than 7 million people. Second to Haiti is Peru, where 3 million people dont have access to power, largely because of the remoteness of the villages where they live. From the Andes to the Amazon, folks are really spread out, said Michael Callahan, CEO of PowerMundo, a social impact startup that distributes off-grid clean energy products from lanterns to micro home solar systems.

But given the smaller market in South America, private money is not yet readily available for the off-grid market. There are many differences between Peru and other regions of the world where many live without access to electricity. Unlike in East Africa or India, mobile payments are not nearly as common in Peru. Another significant difference is that kerosene is illegal in Peru. The goal was to switch people to propane lanterns, but that has not worked in the majority of off-grid communities, said Callahan. \"Instead, people have just gone back to using candles or burning diesel fuel. In Peru, the average income in the rural agricultural communities tends to also be higher than other regions with high rates of energy poverty, so consumers are often able to buy the basic solar LED lanterns outright without financing. Peruvians without access to electricity spend $15 to $20 per month on fuel, which may be more than 10 percent of their income. A solar lantern retails for about $50. There are also smaller, less expensive models that people can purchase, using the savings from avoided fuel costs to buy larger solar lanterns. PowerMundo works with its distributors to offer clean cookstoves and other clean energy products that fit the market as well. Unlike many other off-grid solar providers, PowerMundo is a distributor and facilitator rather than a manufacturer. It chooses best-in-breed technology to deploy, and has worked with providers such as d.light and Greenlight Planet. It uses existing networks of nonprofits that can tap small businesses, such as local general stores, to be the local distributors for products. As PowerMundo scales up beyond lights, it will also have to provide training for its local networks to be able to service solar home systems. Moving beyond solar LEDs, however, will take financing. Until last year, Perus mobile payment platforms were all closed systems provided by each mobile provider. Now, the countrys banks have come together to launch a single platform, Bim, that the three main mobile carriers will offer access to, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. PowerMundo is hoping that access to mobile payments will also start to open up the markets where people have intermittent grid connections, especially on the outskirts of Lima. Callahan said that many of its products, such as the battery-backed solar home systems, are already compatible to be charged by either solar power or a grid connection. The company is working primarily in Peru, and has replicated its model with another organization in Honduras. It has also distributed some products in Bolivia, which would be its next target market beyond Peru.

{"body": " If you think todays wind turbines are big, then just wait until 2030. By then the median hub height for U.S. onshore turbines will hit 115 meters, 33 meters above the current average. And blade tips will swing higher than the Washington Monuments 169 meters, according to 163 experts polled in a studyconducted by four energy research organizations. Offshore wind turbines, which are already larger than their onshore brethren, are set to achieve even greater heights by 2030, the experts said. Todays machines, averaging 4.1 megawatts with a hub height of 90 meters, will be replaced by 11-megawatt giants with hubs 125 meters off sea level and blades spanning 190 meters. Their blade tips will scythe the air at well over twice the height of the Statue of Liberty. And those could be average sizes. We asked the experts to give us a sense for the typical size of turbines in 2030, so the resulting figures should be considered midpoint estimates, not the maximum, said Ryan Wiser of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, one of the bodies involved in the research. This move toward ever-bigger turbines is driven by the quest for lower levelized cost of energy (LCOE), said the studys authors, some of whom also hailed from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the University of Massachusetts and the International Energy Agency. Bigger turbines cost less per megawatt, thanks to economies of scale and lower balance-of-plant costs, and have better performance through taller towers and longer blades. U.S. onshore turbines have already increased twentyfold in size, from 0.1 megawatts and 18 meters in the 1980s to 2 megawatts and 82 meters in 2015. Offshore turbines have only had a decade and a half of development in Europe, but have already grown from an average of 1.6 megawatts and 64 meters in 2000 to 4.1 megawatts and 90 meters last year. Thanks to further increases in size, LCOE is anticipated to decline by 24 percent to 30 percent in 2030 and by 35 percent to 41 percent in 2050, relative to 2014 baseline values, reads the study, which is said to be the largest-ever expert elicitation survey on an energy technology. Another trend noted by the experts is the expanding size of rotors. For the same engine size, an increase in swept rotor area increases the amount of energy captured by the machine with relatively little additional cost. The trend toward longer blades has already helped deliver wind capacity factors above 40 percent, a level unheard of even a few years ago, according to Berkeley Lab. As might be expected from a survey of diverse opinions, there was a fair amount of variability in responses, with some experts predicting that fixed-bottom offshore wind turbines could top 18 megawatts in capacity by 2030. European onshore and offshore typical turbine capacity in 2030 is somewhat larger than estimates for North America, said Wiser. There is an expectation of somewhat larger machines in Europe than North America, consistent with historical trends. Although the study did not consider emerging markets, Aaron Daniels, co-founder and managing director of Thailand-based consultancy Modern Energy Management, said massive turbines were rapidly becoming the norm outside Europe and America. For example, China has mandated development of 10-megawatt offshore wind turbines, he told GTM. And the market is responding, he said. \"Eight-megawatt wind turbines with 164-meter rotors are now commercially available for this market segment, with 10-megawatt turbines planned to be released by some manufacturers. Even the top end of current size expectations could fall short of reality by 2030, Wiser said. Alas, we did not ask about maximum capacities or fundamental limits, he commented. I would note that in the past, most claims that we were reaching a plateau have, so far at least, proven incorrect. Nevertheless, it is clear that wind turbines cannot carry on growing indefinitely. Wiser and Daniels both said there would likely be an upper limit for wind turbine size, potentially dictated by logistics. At some point I suspect there will be diminishing returns, said Daniels. The key is in manufacturing and shipping costs.", "theme": "Products and Technology", "title": "How Big Can Wind Turbines Get?", "comments": "9", "tags": ["lawrence berkeley national laboratory", "offshore wind", "wind capacity factor", "wind turbines"]}
{"body": " Solar tracking market leader NEXTracker today announced an energy storage add-on for its signature product. Solar trackers have seen tremendous growth in the last few years as costs come down. That growth stayedstrong this year in spite of slowdowns and turmoil in other sectors of the solar industry. Trackers now account for 70 percent of U.S. ground-mount projects. As the tracker industry matures, companies are feeling more pressure to differentiate themselves from rivals. The competition is fiercest between NEXTracker and Array Technologies, which respectively controlled 24 percent and 20 percent of the global market in 2015, respectively, according to GTM Research. NEXTracker upped the ante with its newNX Fusion Plus. It leverages \"best-in-class solar tracker, battery, inverter and software technologies,\" the company said, to extend the usefulness of a tracking solar plant. Other tracker companies bundle trackers with inverters and balance-of-system components, and developers could already deploy storage alongside a solar tracker project. But this formulation is a new development for the industry. \"Theres not another tracker vendor that offers that at the moment,\" said Scott Moskowitz, the senior analyst at GTM Research who follows solar trackers. The current plans are to offer two main storage choices, which cater to different sets of customer needs, said NEXTracker CTO Alex Au. One option is the containerized lithium-ion package made by parent company Flex; the other is to integrate long-duration flow batteries from a yet-to-be-announced partner directly into the rows of trackers. \"Were not just white-labeling something; were creating an improved system together and leveraging our existing infrastructure,\" Au said. The DC-coupled flow battery system would be able to absorb solar generation while minimizing the efficiency losses of extra power conversion. It would also address the problem of \"clipping,\" in which generation isn't sent out because a system's inverters can't handle the capacity at a given moment. The storage can hold onto that extra power and push it out at a later time. And, of course, storage can do plenty of other things too. In describing the product, Au endeavored to find a middle path between two extremes: lack of choice and too many choices. \"A lot of times with storage, when you dont have more than one tool for the customer to use, you force a solution and its not as genuine,\" he said. On the other hand, if the storage provider steps back and offers a blank slate, the customer doesn't benefit from the expertise of the company. And if the company builds a custom design for every customer, it forfeits the cost savings that come from a battery design that's highly integrated into the tracking system. Au sees his company's storage packages as \"a toolbox, and there are certain tools needed for certain tasks.\" NEXTracker will suggest the best of the available tools for each customer's use cases. Huge utility-scale solar plants may gravitate toward the lithium-ion option to add some grid services abilities to their portfolio. But NEXTracker will also pursue smaller customers, like farms that struggle with hefty demand charges, or big-box stores that want more control over their energy usage. The lithium-ion product is ready now, Au said. The flow option will leave the factory in Q2 2017. Most of the leads so far are in California, as is to be expected with storage. But Au said his team is examining other markets as well. That points to a constraint inherent to adding storage to the platform: The storage markets themselves are still small and geographically limited. That means the storage-plus-tracker probably won't be a big driver of NEXTracker's bottom line any time soon. \"The real driver for tracker vendors going forward will be the growth of tracking in markets outside of the U.S.,\" Moskowitz said. \"Its going to be places where utility solar is still developing, like China, India, the Middle East and Latin America.\" \"I dont think a storage application is going to fundamentally change that,\" he continued. \"But it should allow NEXTracker to differentiate itself from competitors who dont have that capability, and it lets them appeal to customers who need the specialized production profile that storage provides.\" In the near term, then, the NX Fusion Plus can appeal to specific customers with specifics needs. Longer-term, Au envisions NEXTracker selling fully integrated clean energy systems that can serve their customers as well as the grid. The company has an ongoing project that aims to \"decapitate the duck\" by smoothing out the evening peak of the famous \"duck curve\" with solar production from earlier in the day. This new offering contributes to that, in a streamlined and user-friendly way. The first test will be how many customers want both solar trackers and storage. Solar-plus-storage is trending up, and in the U.S., at least, most large solar installations favor tracking. The prospects there look good. That leaves it up to NEXTracker to prove that those customers would rather buy both from the same vendor.", "theme": "Utility-Scale Solar", "title": "NEXTracker Launches Storage-Paired Solar Tracker", "comments": "5", "tags": ["california", "duck curve", "flex", "flow batteries", "lithium-ion", "nextracker", "pv trackers", "solar", "solar-plus-storage"]}

Trump has selected Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general and a close ally of the fossil fuel industry, to run the Environmental Protection Agency, signaling Mr. Trumps determination to dismantle President Obamas efforts to counter climate change -- and much of the EPA itself. Mr. Pruitt, a Republican, has been a key architect of the legal battle against Mr. Obamas climate change policies, actions that fit with the president-elects comments during the campaign. Mr. Trump has criticized the established science of human-caused global warming as a hoax, vowed to cancel the Paris accord committing nearly every nation to taking action to fight climate change, and attacked Mr. Obamas signature global warming policy, the Clean Power Plan, as a war on coal. Mr. Pruitt has been in lock step with those views.

MIT Technology Review:Greenlands Ice Sheet Is Less Stable Than We Thought Next time youre walking down the street and pass a tree or a tall building, try to eyeball how high up you think 24 feet is. Thats about how much global sea level would rise if the Greenland ice sheet were to melt. A historic new finding, published in the journal Nature, suggests thats a much greater threat than we realized. The result is based on physical evidence in the first-ever piece of bedrock drilled from beneath the northern hemispheres largest ice deposit. Scientists led by Joerg Schafer at Columbia University looked at isotopes in the rock sample that indicate how long it was ice-free. Scientists thought the ice sheet had been stable for at least the last 1.4 million years, and perhaps much longer. But the new study shows that the part of Greenland where the sample was taken was melted down to bedrock for at least 280,000 years during that time. In order for that to be true, models of the ice sheet say it mustve shrunk to less than 10 percent of its current size.

{"body": " Update: On December 13, The Washington Post reported that Department of Energy officials have refused the transition team's request for the names of DOE employees and contractors who have worked on climate-related issues.  The Department of Energy received significant feedback from our workforce throughout the department, including the National Labs, following the release of the transition teams questions. Some of the questions asked left many in our workforce unsettled, Eben Burnham-Snyder, a department spokesman, wrote in an email to the Post. Our career workforce, including our contractors and employees at our labs, comprise the backbone of DOE (Department of Energy) and the important work our department does to benefit the American people. We are going to respect the professional and scientific integrity and independence of our employees at our labs and across our department. We will be forthcoming with all publically-available information with the transition team. We will not be providing any individual names to the transition team,\" he wrote, adding boldface for emphasis.  *** After one month and a couple of shakeups, the Trump transition team is finally getting to work at the Department of Energy. And staff is already nervous. This week, the Trump team sent around a list of 74 questions to leadership asking how different organizations within the $30 billion department operate. GTM acquired the list of 65 questions. E&E News published an additional listthat included government labs. Bloomberg initiallybroke the storyon Thursday night, but did not publish the list outright. Many of the questions are straightforward: \"Where does EIA think most improvement is needed in its data and analyses?\" Onlookers have been asking that question for some time. Some of them suggest skepticism about the cost of renewables: \"EIA's assessments of levelized costs for renewable technologies do not contain backup costs for the fossil fuel technologies that are brought on-line to replace the generation when those technologies are down. Is this is a correct representation of the true levelized costs?\" And a few of them are vaguely authoritarian: \"Can you provide a list of Department employees or contractors who attended any of the Conference of the Parties in the last five years?\" (If that's not clear: The transition team wants a list of everyone in the organization who attended global climate talks. It also wants a list naming anyone who worked on identifying the social cost of carbon.) According to one long-time DOE staffer who requested anonymity, asking for that kind of employee and contractor list \"is absolutely not normal.\" \"Most people I have talked to just feel really uncomfortable with the line of questioning,\" said the source. Others within DOE say the majority of other questions are normal and thoughtful -- and may be a good opportunity for the department to argue for the success of loan guarantees, advanced manufacturing, and other programs specific to renewable energy. However, they also expressed concern about the request for staff names. Speculation about the Trump team's energy priorities has run rampant since the election. No one within the department knows what to expect, or how to read conflicting signals from the president-elect. Thomas Pyle, the new transition team leader, only arrived at DOE last week. The leaked list of questions offers additional insight into how Trump's administration might run DOE. They plan to scrutinize data collection at EIA, examine ARPA-E's investments in emerging clean technologies, open the books on loan guarantees, place a much greater emphasis on nuclear power, and place less emphasis on climate priorities.

EIA's assessments of levelized costs for renewable technologies do not contain back-up costs for the fossil fuel technologies that are brought on-line to replace the generation when those technologies are down. Is this is a correct representation of the true levelized costs? 11. Has EIA done analysis that shows that additional back-up generation is not needed? How does EIA analysis compare with other analyses on this issue? 12. Renewable and solar technologies are expected to need additional transmission costs above what fossil technologies need. How has EIA represented this in the AEO forecasts? What is the EIA magnitude of those transmission costs? 13.

{"body": " SolarCity:These 3 Maps Show the Absurd Growth Potential of Rooftop Solar in America Solar power in America is on a roll. Over the last decade, the cost of solar installations in the U.S. has fallen by more than 70 percent, and every year has had more solar installed than the last. Since 2010, the nations solar power capacity has grown fifteenfold. And employment in the U.S. solar industry recently surpassed 200,000 people -- thats more than the oil and gas extraction industry, and three times more than the coal-mining industry. Its really just the beginning though. To grasp solars enormous untapped potential, we can start by looking at home rooftop solar. There are already more than 1.1 million home solar rooftops in the U.S. today -- including more than 300,000 SolarCity installations -- but the coming years are likely to make that look small. Using publicly available data, weve produced the three maps below to convey the absurdly large growth potential of home rooftop solar in America. East Bay Times:City Council Approves Major Tesla Facility Expansion Plan The Fremont City Council on Tuesday night approved Tesla Motors plan for expansion that could potentially double the companys manufacturing site in the citys south end. According to city reports, the plan lays out a development pattern for the site in order to facilitate future growth for the company. Teslas master plan includes workups for a potential 4.6 million square feet of new structures for expanded operations to support, among other things, the rollout and production of the companys still-unreleased Model 3 car. Christian Science Monitor:GM Executive in Europe Says 15 Percent of Cars Sold in Europe by 2030 Will Be Electric The 238-mile 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV electric car should begin deliveries in the coming weeks. But sales of the Bolt EV's European cousin -- the Opel Ampera-e -- won't begin until well into the next year. Because it offers a range of over 200 miles at a mainstream price ($37,495, before federal, state, and local incentives), Chevy has high hopes for the impact of the Bolt EV on the U.S. electric-car market. Business Insider: Demand for Electric Cars Is Low -- but Automakers Continue to Roll Them Out One of the biggest critics of electric cars also runs one of the worlds largest automakers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles CEO Sergio Marchionne has as much as begged customers to avoid buying his electric vehicles (EVs) because he loses so much money on them. Demand for EVs isn't just weak -- it's practically nonexistent. Globally, electric cars have captured only 1% of the market.

{"body": " An off-grid solar-plus-storage setup is helping prevent villagers in a remote part of Myanmar from suffering one of the most painful deaths imaginable. Every year around 300 people in the country die from snake bites, with Russells viper, Daboia russelii, being one of the main culprits. The Russells viper, which grows to more than five feet in length, is one of the worlds deadliest snakes, with bite victims experiencing a mortality rate of up to 92 percent. Victims can start showing signs of poisoning with 15 minutes and may begin bleeding from the gums within 20 minutes. The heart falters. Up to 30 percent of those bitten suffer kidney failure, and death can occur up to a fortnight after the attack -- but usually occurs within six to eight hours. Other poisonous snakes in Myanmar include the spitting cobra and the banded krait. According to World Health Organization figures from 2014, around 15,000 people get bitten every year. The country has a snake bite mortality rate double the world average. Bringing that mortality rate down relies on administering the correct antivenin for each bite, as quickly as possible. But while Myanmars health system has been working hard to increase the amount of antivenin it stocks, it still faces a major problem in rural regions where there is no electricity, since the antidote needs to be kept at temperatures under 25 C. As a result, snake bite fatalities have historically remained high in villages such as Yin Ma Chaung, in the Magway Region of Myanmar. A nine-hour drive from Myanmars former capital Yangon, the 140 households that make up Yin Ma Chaung are deep in snake country. Until recently, they were far from the nearest antivenin source. In a video posted by Panasonic, villager San E recounts how three members of his family, including his daughter, suffered snake bites. On the most tragic occasion, The snake serum didnt get here in time, so my daughter didnt make it, he said. I still feel angry sometimes. In 2011, a no-profit called the Mae Fah Luang Foundation (MFL Foundation), funded by the Kingdom of Thailand, began talking to villagers in Yin Ma Chaung and 28 other nearby villages about solving the snakebite problem. As a result, says Panasonic: Health workers from the MFL Foundation stationed in eight villages in the region built simple coolers powered by solar power. But the devices are prone to frequent malfunction, so the workers could never be fully confident in them. This year the foundation overcame the problem with a Panasonic Power Supply Station equipped with 2.82 kilowatts of solar power and 17.2 kilowatt-hours of energy storage from twenty-four 12-volt lead-acid batteries.  The power supply station, installed with help from Matsui, powers an antivenin fridge, runs a community center, and provides rudimentary street lighting so villagers can move around Yin Ma Chaung at night without fear of treading on snakes. In the community center, a television and a fan have been set up, and study sessions and sutra sessions are now offered for children there, said Yurie Sato of Eco Networks, a Japanese sustainability network working with Panasonic. There are currently no moves to extend the concept to other villages, but Panasonic plans to continue providing products, including Power Supply Stations, to help solve the various social issues faced by people living in areas without electricity, she told GTM. In a press note, Panasonic said 68 percent of households in Myanmar were off the grid. This level soars to 84 percent in rural areas. Distributed renewable generation is only just beginning to take off in the country, although grid-scale solar is expanding rapidly. In other developing regions, meanwhile, there is growing interest in renewable energy and storage for off-grid electrification and healthcare provision. Earlier this year, for example, Scottsdale, Arizona-based Fluidic Energy announced a deal to provide renewable energy mini-grid technology to 100 villages and 400,000 people in Madagascar. And last month, Dulas, a Welsh renewable energy technology company, confirmed it was sending 345 solar-powered direct-drive fridges to help with vaccination efforts in Yemen, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

{"body": " It is no secret that natural gas and wind power are the cheapest sources for electricity generation in much of the U.S. But when accounting for local rules and availability, the picture of the lowest cost for new power generation in the U.S. becomes more nuanced, according to a new interdisciplinary study by the University of Texas at Austin. The study began with the levelized cost of energy for each source, but then added in public health impacts and carbon emissions to calculate the \"full cost of electricity.\" The study also accounted for costs and availability of each technology at the county level. It brought together researchers from UTs Energy Institute, business school, mechanical and chemical engineering departments, school of public affairs and department of energy economics. The high level results are not surprising. Without externalities, natural gas is the cheapest in much of the country, with wind dominating in the upper Midwest. Other studies, however, have found that the cost of utility-scale solar is well within the range of combined-cycle natural gas plants and wind power. Globally, Bloomberg New Energy Finance has found wind and solar will become the least-cost option in most regions within a decade. Add in externalities, and wind and natural gas are still the cheapest options, while coal and solar of all sizes cannot compete.The researchers included upstream, downstream and ongoing emissions as part of its life cycle emissions rates. Solar PV, for example, had the second highest upstream, one-time emissions rate due to its manufacturing process, but zero emissions once operational.  We think our methodology is sound and hope it enhances constructive dialogue, Joshua Rhodes, postdoctoral research fellow at the Energy Institute and lead author of the paper, said in a statement. But we also know that cost factors change over time, and people disagree about whether to include some of them. There is huge variability in how emissions for solar manufacturing are calculated, even by studies that used PV systems in the same year, according to a recent study in Nature Communications. The clear trend, however, is a smaller greenhouse footprint than in the past for solar, according to the Nature study. The study noted that the greenhouse gas footprint for state-of-the-art monocrystalline silicon based PV systems is about half what it was a decade ago. Utility-scale solar PV was notably absent from the first scenario in the UT study, but when the availability of each technology is assessed with county and local restrictions on siting being accounted for, the pictures becomes more complex.  In this scenario, nuclear and solar gain a foothold, with wind and natural gas combined cycle still the cheapest option for new power in most U.S. counties. Residential solar is attractive in pockets in Florida and Georgia and even upstate New York. Where wind resources are marginal and gas prices are high or pipelines dont flow, nuclear often becomes the next best option. The report is meant to inform local policy discussions, and also engage stakeholders to further the conversation. The project also comes with online calculators. We wanted to provide an opportunity for people to change these inputs, said Rhodes, and the tools weve created allow for that.", "theme": "Markets & Policy", "title": "Where Are Residential Solar and Nuclear Cheaper Than Natural Gas?", "comments": "64", "tags": ["emissions costs", "energy cost", "ghg emissions", "lcoe", "natural gas", "solar power", "ut austin", "wind power"]}
{"body": " What would an expansion of the California wholesale market to a broader Western regional market mean for businesses looking to buy renewable energy? We recently tried to answer that question at a seminar. After a stimulating discussion with representatives from Fix the Grid, Energy GPS, MISO, and Bay Area-based corporate buyers, our takeaway is that a regional Western grid would increase the opportunity to contract for cost-effective renewable energy. Its well known that the installed cost of wind and solar has declined dramatically over the past several years; Lazards Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis 9.0 quotes a decline of 60 percent and 80 percent since 2009, respectively. This cost-competitiveness has been a driver of the increased corporate interest in buying renewable energy viaphysical or virtual power purchase agreements to support their sustainability or greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction strategies. The creation of a Western RSO (an aggregation of state markets in Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Colorado, Utah and Arizona) would change the landscape for renewable energy buyers in a few different ways. In order to accommodate intermittent generation, the grid needs flexibility. Wind and solar cause significant noise in the energy system throughout the day based on the weather conditions that exist. In order to manage this intermittency, the system operator must create financial incentives for flexible and ramping products to help smooth out variability (i.e., natural-gas-fired power plants, energy storage, demand response). The operational costs of these flexible generation and load resources equate to the cost of integrating renewables. A geographically diverse regionalized grid would increase efficiency and decrease integration costs. The amount of flexible resources required for reliability would decrease in proportion to the overall system size because the impact of localized weather events and the corresponding spikes or plunges in renewable generation are less pronounced when the supply and demand on the system are spread across a larger physical area. Since RSOs are revenue-neutral organizations, operational costs are spread across all generators via grid charges. A decrease in the cost of integrating intermittent resources would result in lower operating costs for renewable generators, allowing developers to pass through a more competitive PPA price to the buyer.  Once a seller and a buyer agree to a PPA price, the buyer reaps the benefit of the energy price and the renewable energy certificate price in the market. In CAISO, the value of renewables, specifically solar, has decreased over time as more generation has been integrated into the system. This is largely due to oversupply when the sun is shining. FIGURE: Historical and Projected WholesaleMarket Value of Solar in2025 With and Without a Western ISO (WISO)  Source: Energy GPS Before significant solar capacity was installed, periods of high solar production were closely correlated with periods of high energy usage (hot days mean more air conditioning) and peak electricity prices. Now, with more than 10 gigawatts of solar installed across CAISO, the periods of maximum solar output more frequently correspond with low or negative wholesale prices. The degraded solar value is problematic for businesses that may be buying solar via a virtual PPA, under which they benefit from wholesale prices above the PPA rate but are required to pay the delta when wholesale prices fall below the PPA rate. Within a Western RSO, it would be easier to move power around the grid thanks to alternate transmission paths, and renewables can become a cost-effective export during periods of over-generation. Analysis from Energy GPS estimates that the average wholesale price for solar in 2025 would be ~120 percent higher if the West moved to a regionalized grid. By expanding CAISO market constructs to neighboring states, physical purchases and virtual PPAs would be available to buyers throughout the Western grid. Under the current grid structure, a business that is interested in purchasing Washington wind via a virtual PPA is likely to transact at the Mid-Columbia trading hub (one of two liquid points in the Pacific Northwest). The buyer would bear the costs associated with delivering and liquidating power to the trading hub, including transmission, logistics, and the bid/offer spread. Additionally, the buyer would be subject to pricing at Mid-Columbia that is less reliable and more at risk of volatility than a hub within an independent system operator (ISO) territory; Mid-Columbia is an informal hub and lacks the formal market rules that come with an ISO. Alternatively, a similar project in CAISO would face none of the delivery costs and would be earning revenue from capacity payments (resource adequacy). The buyer would also benefit from greater wholesale price certainty at a hub that is subject to ISO market rules (such as NP-15or SP-15). If both projects started at the same price, the CAISO project could be delivered at a lower cost to the corporate buyer. Moving to a Western RSO would increase the availability of cost-effective transaction structures for corporate buyers across the Western grid. As detailed above, the creation of a regionalized Western grid would be beneficial for businesses looking to purchase cost-competitive renewable energy and decrease their Scope 2 GHG emissions. When considering renewable energy purchases in the West, corporate buyers should also keep in mind that an expanded RSO will allow for a cleaner grid overall -- integrating renewables across a broader geographic region can reduce the need for redundant baseload resources and support the shutdown of fossil generation. With a regionalized Western grid, there will be more options for buying cost-effective renewables,and the energy from your utility will be less carbon-intensive. In our opinion, these benefits add up to a very compelling case for business to support an expanded RSO. With federal climate policy uncertain, it is increasingly important for renewable adoption to be driven by cities, states and the private sector. *** Carolyn Campbell is a manager of renewable energy procurement at 3Degrees, where she sources renewable energy and carbon mitigation solutions for corporate clients.

{"body": " Bill Gates just revealed more information about his plan, first unveiled about a year ago, to bring together a group of billionaires to fund breakthroughs in energy technology that can fight climate change. The group, which has a collective net worth of $170 billion, is one of the most star-studded and diverse ever assembled to fund any kind of technology innovation. But will the big new fund be more successful than the mostly lackluster attempt at cleantech investing of the past decade? On Monday, Gates and his group announced a new $1 billion fund -- called Breakthrough Energy Ventures-- which will invest in science-based energy research, entrepreneurs and companies in areas like generating cheap clean energy, capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions, and making buildings more energy-efficient. The fund plans to make investments in both early-stage tech projects and later-stage companies. Unlike a traditional VC fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures plans to make investments over a 20-year period, intends to offer larger amounts of capital to companies that can be commercialized, and also plans to partner closely with university labs.  The fund includes investments from well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalists John Doerr andVinod Khosla, who both led cleantech investments at their firms over the past several years. Among the list of 21 investors, big names include Alibaba founder Jack Ma, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Virgin founder Richard Branson and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. Board members include energy hedge fund manager John Arnold, the Chairman of Reliance Mukesh Ambani, SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner, as well as Ma, Khosla and Doerr. Gates is listed as the chairman of the board.  The fund will be a rare source of new financing for energy tech innovation, an area which has been fairly neglected in recent years in many regions.  About a decade ago, many investors in Silicon Valley jumped into funding cleantech startups, but years later many dropped those efforts after losing money. High-profile cleantech failures like solar startup Solyndra, electric car company Fisker Automotive, and biofuel company KiOR scared off many.  However, the devil will be in the details for how the fund plans to make its investments, and if it will be more successful than past attempts. Gates, Khosla and Doerr have already funded dozens of companies around energy storage, biofuels and solar manufacturing with few big wins to show so far.  Will the trio use Breakthrough Energy Ventures to double down on their prior model of investing, just with a bigger fund and with capital outside of the confines of their firms?  According to the investors on a media call on Monday afternoon, their cleantech investing will be different this time around. Gates, Doerr and Khosla gave every indication on the call that the fund would take full advantage of everything theyve learned from the industrys past mistakes. Doerr described the fund as bespoke, and designed for the unique nature of the opportunity.  Well take a lot of learnings over the last decade of energy investing and apply them here, he said. Doerr described the lessons learned as: Energy tech breakthroughs need to be revolutionary instead of evolutionary, technologies need to have a clear market and the innovations need to be backed by an outstanding team. Investors also need to take a really long point of view, and also be willing to put two, three or maybe even five times more capital into companies than in an average VC investment, said Doerr.  He also noted that winning with energy tech breakthroughs is harder than usual.  I cant guarantee that it will happen, said Doerr on commercializing successful energy tech companies, but he said the group is focused on enabling better, faster and cheaper energy and a zero-carbon planet by 2050. I would never underestimate the power of energy entrepreneurs to change the game here, said Doerr.  Khosla said that the fund would give investors the ability to be patient and take larger risks. That type of investing can also create a much better opportunity for returns, said Khosla. However, the board members didnt provide more details on what expected returns might look like or how deals would be structured. Arnold said the fund would only make an investment if the technology could have a large impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In that way, the group is very mission-focused.  Gates said that investors would take more of a hands-on approach with entrepreneurs and companies, helping them find strategic partners and follow-on financing.  Within the next three months, Breakthrough Energy Ventures plans to hire managers to make its investments and do due diligence on entrepreneurs and research ideas. Its unclear just how much involvement and influence the board members like Gates, Doerr and Khosla would have over investment choices.  The selection of the management team will be very important to determine just how different this cleantech investing project will be, compared to past efforts. Will these folks come from the traditional Silicon Valley venture capital world?  After it became clear that the traditional Silicon Valley model of VC investing hasnt worked so far for cleantech, a variety of new models have been introduced. Those include Cyclotron Road, which is collaborating closely with university labs; the energy research shop of Otherlab; regionally focused groups like the Energy Excelerator;and industry-focused projects like Powerhouse. Former Khosla Ventures partner Andrew Chung recently launched a $200 million fund with 1955 Capital to invest in technologies to manage resources in emerging markets like China. Whatever team ends up managing Breakthrough Energy Ventures, they should be well versed in whats worked and what hasnt. Breakthrough Energy Ventures says it plans to invest on a 20-year horizon, instead of the typical VC model which expects returns in a much shorter time period, like five years. Breakthrough investors will also be willing to put in larger funding rounds -- seven-, eight- and nine-figure investments -- into established companies that can be commercialized, said Arnold.  The fund, which has a pool structure, has already had a first close with a commitment of a billion dollars, and plans to have a second close in the spring of 2017. The fund will also invest internationally, said the board members.  The investors, like Khosla, still plan to make their own investments through their own firms. Arnold said on the call that the group is developing a conflict of interest policy to examine investments by Breakthrough Energy Ventures compared to investments backed by funds from board members own firms. While the board members said all the right things on the media call, the fund appears to be an evolved venture capital fund with some important different parameters. But will that be different enough to get different results? The question remains if any form of venture capital is really appropriate to fund difficult-to-achieve energy tech innovations.

{"body": " In December 1989, Clark Griswolds impressive lighting display caused a peaking power plant to come on-line somewhere in Illinois. Fast-forward to 2016, however, and the Clark Griswolds of the world (or at least of New York state) have switched to LED string lights in droves. The technology revolution of this seasonal staple has resulted in a substantial drop in energy use. New Yorks grid operator reported on Monday that holiday-light energy use has declined by about one-third from 2010, largely due to the switch to LEDs. This year, holiday lighting will add about 750 megawatts of load, down from about 1,150 megawatts in 2010. Of course, the peaking power plant in National Lampoons Christmas Vacation was a Hollywood contrivance, as most regions of the U.S. have ample electricity supply in wintertime In New York, for example, this winters peak demand will only require about half of the available electricity resources in the state. The move to LEDs is not limited to holiday season, however. (According to GE Lighting market research, that season begins around Veterans Day.) LEDs are now cost-competitive with compact fluorescent bulbs and often provide superior performance. People are also starting to understand that LEDs do not only come in the harsh white light that was the only option just a few years ago. As for Christmas lights, the advantages of the low-powered bulbs are considerable. The minimal power needs -- about 75 percent less than incandescent -- mean that the lights can run off of battery packs, eliminating annoying cords for everything from window candlestick lights to outdoor displays. Some exterior holiday lights even run on solar power. Also, Energy Star-certified string lights can last about 10 times longer than traditional light strands, and they dont heat up. If the considerable energy savings of LEDs this holiday season doesnt warm your heart, consider another statistic of far greater significance. In the same period that LEDs have been curbing electricity needs in the New York winter, they have also been transforming lives in the developing world. Since 2010, more than 35 million people have been moved from zero energy access to Tier 1, which is access to basic, modern lighting and cell phone charging, mostly because of LED solar lanterns. The LED lanterns are important not only for providing better illumination, but also because they have eliminated more than 20 million traditional, and often dangerous, lighting sources, primarily kerosene lanterns.", "theme": "Lighting", "title": "LEDs Cut New Yorks Christmas-Light Energy Needs by 35%", "comments": "5", "tags": ["christmas lights", "energy efficiency", "led", "nyiso", "string lights"]}

They each serve the noble goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, when combined, they might actually lead to increased emissions.

The bill would sharply curtail the benefit that homeowners, churches, businesses and schools now reap by harnessing the sun's energy.

But the industry rejected the report, saying that wood energy cuts carbon significantly compared to fossil fuels. The Guardian: How Drones Are Helping Design the Solar Power Plants of the Future At the edge of a plot of muddy farmland, a few miles down the road from the University of California at Davis, an engineer takes a few quick steps across crop rows and lets go of a three-foot drone. Within seconds, the device -- which weighs less than 2 lbs. and carries a powerful camera -- ascends hundreds of feet into the cold, clear, blue sky and begins to snap detailed photos of the ground far below, including a long row of large solar panels mounted on steel poles. This flight is just a test, demonstrated by Kingsley Chen, the drone fleet coordinator for SunPower at the solar companys research and development center, which is under construction and about a two-hour drive northeast of the San Francisco Bay Area.

{"body": " Last week, Californias quest for a clean grid revolution culminated in the introduction of a bill mandating 100 percent renewable energy by 2045. Senator Kevin de Len, a longtime environmental leader in the state senate, wrote the measure, which comes on the heels of last years major greenhouse gas reduction bill. Massachusetts legislators introduced the same goal with a deadline of 2035. Momentum behind such efforts has grown stronger in defiance of President Donald Trumps antediluvian approach to climate science. But it's too early to assess the chances of these passing. It's easier to prognosticate on the effects of passing such a goal. And there's a lot of evidence that 100 percent renewable energy is not the optimal way to decarbonize the grid. Opponents of renewable energy incentives often use the argument that government shouldn't pick winners and losers. There's a big difference between giving fledgling, socially beneficial technologies a boost so they can compete effectively in a calcified marketplace, and using the power of government to favor one set of mature companies over another in providing a similar service. The legal requirement to source 100 percent renewable energy looks more like the latter. But let's say climate change requires massive government investment in clean technologies. In that case, the question shifts to one of efficacy: Since climate change justifies extraordinary measures, what is the most effective extraordinary measure to fight it? Thats where 100 percent renewables plans fall short, for both structural and practical reasons. The stated goal is to decarbonize the electric grid. Converting all electrical generation to some combination of wind, hydro and solar is one way to achieve this goal. The proposals at hand would make that particular method the endpoint. At best, this is indirect policy: Instead of saying figure out the best way to decarbonize the grid, it says, figure out how to deploy a prescribed set of energy resources which should lead to the decarbonization of the grid. At worst, its picking one path to the exclusion of other, potentially better, paths. Here's how Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems researcher at MIT, framed this problem: Why would we want to constrain ourselves to a narrow set of options to confront climate change and air pollution and other energy sector challenges when those challenges are already quite difficult? This only makes sense if it's possible to prove that some combination of wind, hydro and solar is the most practical route to a zero-carbon grid, accounting for speed, cost and probability of success. Not only should it beat every option currently available, but any future possibilities based on technological progress in the next several decades. Arguably the most prominent planners of the 100 percent renewable approach are Mark Jacobson of Stanford University and Mark Delucchi of UC-Berkeley, and they end up arguing that the ramp-up of renewable production to power the whole country is possible given our nation's previous success withWorld War II-era societal mobilization. That's an inspiring precedent, but not one you'd like to see guiding a feasibility study. We dont know that a 100 percent renewable approach is the fastest, cheapest or easiest way to decarbonize the grid. We do know that it will be expensive and hard enough that its own advocates compare it to the most gargantuan collective effort in the nations history. Setting aside the case for keeping options open, the operational realities of a completely renewables-powered grid create challenges that could be avoided with other zero-carbon configurations. Solar and wind alone cannot be relied upon for constant service. This requires some combination of: 1) overbuilding capacity over a geographically dispersed region; 2) using a whole lot of storage; and 3) dramatically improving regional import and export of electricity. If solar and wind form the baseload, you have to prepare for the scenario when the sun is mostly blocked and wind is weak. One way to do this is building enough extra capacity that with all the fleet operating at its trough of productivity, there is still enough to power the system. That requires building capacity well beyond the reserves required of thermal plants, which produce a much higher percentage of their potential output. This multiplies the cost of the build-out, which is compounded by the diminishing returns of additional renewable capacity. With so much extra solar on the grid, grid operators have to deal with over-generation when the weather conditions are optimal. Solar and wind plants may have to curtail their output under such conditions. The more solar that goes onto the grid without a productive use, the more curtailment any additional solar facilities will face. Value declines due to curtailment because each unit of potential PV production no longer displaces one unit of fossil generation, states a study from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory on how to reach 50 percent PV penetration in California. As curtailment increases, the benefits of additional PV may drop to the point where additional installations are not worth the cost, creating an economic limit to deployment. Storage offers a hopeful way out of this conundrum, allowing renewables to act more like traditional power plants. California has almost single-handedly jump-started the advanced storage industry by setting a statewide mandate, but the state is still in the early stages of this rollout. That means utilities are still testing how storage works on the grid, and how it performs after several years of service -- both of which are crucial to planning a grid that is all renewables. Residential storage is even more nascent, with companies scrounging for customers and small-scale pilot programs. Residential storage could play a role in balancing the grid and shifting loads, but it needs to reach millions more customers to fulfill that role. Additionally, expanding Californias grid connections with its neighbors would smooth the renewable expansion by allowing more imports and exports at opportune times. This kind of interconnectivity of transmission lines takes a long time and requires coordination with several states -- and it's also quite controversial in the region. Even with optimal grid improvements, California would still need an estimated 15 gigawatts of additional storage just to reach 50 percent solar by 2030, according to an NRELstudy. Thats more than 11 times the amount of storage mandated currently in California, and 66 times the total megawatts deployed in the U.S. last year. This represents a massively expensive undertaking. A different studyfrom Jenkins and researchers at Argonne National Lab demonstrates how the need for storage goes down if the grid includes some sort of flexible baseload power in addition to intermittent renewables. More flexible nuclear power or natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) could fill this role, in places where substantial hydropower isnt available. Small modular nuclear reactors are still in a very early stage of regulatory review, and CCS has not achieved commercial success, so these are not certain options. A lot can happen in 28 years, though, and a zero-carbon mandate for the California market would be a powerful driver for development of such technologies. Again, thats if Californias goal is to achieve a zero-carbon grid -- rather than just solely boost renewables. In a previous interview, Jenkins described what proposals like the one in California will accomplish:Its not saying this is the best pathway forward in terms of any metric, particularly in terms of cost. They say, How much can we push renewables and only renewables? And what will be necessary to try to decarbonize with that pathway alone? Choosing that pathway alone will mean all kinds of other decarbonization pathways get shut out.

{"body": " Anticipation for Elon Musk'sinvestor note and analyst Q&A was high last week. For the first time since the SolarCity acquisition, Tesla executives discussed 2016 results and production plans for the coming years. Here are some takeaways. EV pioneer Tesla's fate depends on the production ramp-up of its $35,000 \"mainstream\" Model 3. Musk said that his firm is \"on track for initial production\" in July, followed by \"volume production by September.\" At some point in Q4, Tesla says it will be able to make 5,000 Model 3 cars per week, followed by 10,000 Model 3 cars per week in 2018. These are aggressive plans -- the firm has not yet started road-testing the production model. As previously reported, Tesla started making early prototypes of Model 3 cars just this month, as part of the process of testing the design and manufacturing. Guidance for 2017 was held to H1 deliveries (47,000-50,000 units), capex and auto margins, with no forecast of H2 margins, opexor solar targets. \"I currently think that we should build...500,000 vehicles next year and 1 million vehicles by 2020. That's 500,000 vehicles in total, Model S, Model 3, and Model X combined next year,\" said Musk. Musk said Tesla has enough capital to reach the market with the Model 3, but its cash situation would be close to the edge.\" To reduce the companys risk, it probably makes sense to raise more capital.\" UBS writes, \"Cash burn was bad and is getting worse.\" According to UBS, even with a $155 per kilowatt-hour battery pack cost in 2025, \"the Model 3 will still cost about $7,000 more to build than an equivalent ICE vehicle.\" Tesla announced the resignation of CFO Jason Wheeler and the hiring of Deepak Ahuja (who served as Tesla's CFO from 2008 until 2015), for the position. Ahuja will earn a base salary of $500,000 and a $15 million equity grant. Tesla received notice from Wheeler on February 21, a day before Q4 earnings were issued. Tesla installed 201 megawatts of solar versus a guidance of 250 megawatts. The firm is now looking to \"prioritize cash preservation over growth of megawatts deployed\" ahead of the solar roof tile product launch later this year. Tesla aims \"to reduce customer acquisition costs by cutting advertising spending, selling solar products in Tesla stores, and shifting from leasing to selling solar energy systems. \"Tesla has a very strong global brand. We've got a great retail footprint. So, we've got the pieces in place to really drive customer acquisition cost down.\" 28 percent of solar capacity deployed during Q4 was sold rather than leased, up from 13 percent sold in Q3, and less than 4 percent in Q4 2015. Battery cell production started at the Gigafactory and Tesla sold 98 megawatt-hours of storage products during the fourth quarter, the better part installed at Aliso Canyon. Other grid-scale projects include the Mira Loma substation, a 20-megawatt/80-megawatt-hour energy storage system for SCE, and a solar power and battery storage-enabled microgrid in American Samoa. If one makes a WAG of average pricing ranging from $225 per kilowatt-hour to $450 per kilowatt-hour, then large-scale energy storage revenue for the quarter at Tesla was $22 million to $44 million. All Tesla vehicles in production have the hardware necessary for full self-driving, according to the firm. Musk acknowledged \"some challenges in the transition from Mobileye to Tesla software.\" \"We could have released Tesla Vision and including 'high speed,' probably three months ago -- I was driving at 'high speed' personally three months ago, but I think we want to just have an exhaustive testing process, vetting process before enabling that throughout the fleet. So, we've been edging our way up there gradually. Now, longitudinal control, the Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is at 80 miles an hour. And Autosteer is at 50 miles an hour, and I think we should be able to get, unless testing shows something different, we should be able to get them both to around the maybe 85 miles an hour next month.\" If vehicles with autopilot and self-driving features are probably more safe than other cars on a per-mile-driven basis, shouldn't insurance premiums reflect that? In fact, Tesla is already offering its own insurance product. The CFO said, \"On Asia in particular, where we started this, now the majority of Tesla cars are sold with an insurance product that is customized to Tesla. It takes into account not only this autopilot safety features, but also the maintenance cost of the car. So, it's our vision in the future that we'll be able to offer a single price for the car, maintenance, and insurance, in a really compelling offering for the consumer.\" Musk was discussing manufacturing: \"Calculating the area under the curve is tricky when you're in an exponential. And it always starts out tiny and then spools up. Well, it spools up exponentially, but generally people have trouble wrapping their minds around an exponential, the natural tendency is to extrapolate on the straight line. And so, that's why it was important to emphasize that this is -- the spool up is an exponential. It kind of does get into a linear zone, and then it goes into a logarithm.\" \"We're going to continue to drive efficiencies in G&A. We have to do that. In part, because we can't fit people in the building. It may seems like a silly concern, but it's really quite difficult. We have a real volumetric problem. It's a good constraint to have. So, parking is like one of my biggest nightmares. Where do we park everyone? You can't fit everyone. So we have to make our opex better because there's nowhere for people to go.\" *** Thanks to SA for the transcript.

{"body": " When Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, some in the solar industry worried they might become a political target. Eliminating federal tax credits or stripping funding for Department of Energy's renewables programs are one option. But the government can undermine solar in more subtle ways. And some negative policy changes impacting solar may already be underway. Here's what to watch for. Every solar project needs a PPA driver, something that incentivizes (or forces) a customer to buy renewable energy. In the U.S., that driver has long been renewable portfolio standards put in place by state legislatures. But lately,RPSs are being replaced by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, or PURPA, as a key driver of new PPAs. And PURPA may be easier to undermine than it seems. PURPA was passed in 1978 to give renewable energy a way to compete against fossil fuels that dominated electricity generation. In reality, it was a policy that was intended to give small hydroelectric plants a path to the grid if they could generate electricity for less than the \"avoided cost\" of competing plants, but it's recently become a huge driver of solar energy development. With solar pricing falling below 5 cents per kilowatt-hour in many states, solar is now less than the avoided cost of energy from fossil fuels. If the rules stay the way they're written today, PURPA will drive more solar adoption in more and more states every year. Utilities are starting to see this as a threat and PURPA challenges are coming in Oregon, North Carolina, Utah, Montana, Utah, and elsewhere around the country. There may be some heavyweight players behind trying to change PURPA in a way that hurts solar energy. \"Berkshire Hathaway and Duke Energy have long wanted to amend PURPA, whether it's through Congress or FERC, and I would bet there will be another swing at that,\" said Vote Solar's Adam Browning. If these challenges fall on more sympathetic ears in legislatures or at FERC than they have in years past, it could negatively impact solar. States set the avoided cost, interconnection rules, and contract length terms, while FERC acts like a referee for state regulatory bodies. Changing the contract length could have a surprisingly big impact on an industry like solar energy. Longer contracts with better offtakers and lower interest rates will decrease the price they have to bid per kilowatt-hour on projects. Any changes in the status quo would likely raise the rate they would have to charge, making them less competitive in the market. As Browning put it: \"If you're trying to develop a solar project, it's all capital cost. There's not a utility in the world who would develop a solar project if they were only on a 2-year contract, and yet those are the terms they want to change the contract terms for [qualifying facilities] from 20 or 15 years down to 2 years.\" Now that PURPA is the top driver of new solar developments, it'll be an important policy for the industry to keep in place. It may not be as easy as it was a year ago. The falling cost of solar has gotten a lot of attention over the past few years, but that's not the only factor leading to lower PPA prices across the U.S. Falling interest rates have been a huge tailwind. Any change in monetary policy, led by the Federal Reserve, could have a big negative impact, particularly on the utility and non-residential markets. Renewable energy projects have to justify their large capital expenditures with predictable cash flows for 20-plus years down the road. And then those cash flows are discounted in today's dollars with a discount rate that's based on market rates. If the Federal Reserve raises rates, the result is either lower value for solar projects or higher prices for electricity from future projects. Let's say, for example, you have a solar project that has predictable, contracted cash flows of $1 million per year for the next 25 years. If the rate of return investors demand is 7 percent, then the project is worth $11.65 million. But if the rate of return rises just one percentage point to 8 percent, the value of the project falls 8.4 percent to $10.67 million. A rise to 9 percent reduces the value by 15.7 percent to $9.82 million. Late last year, the Fed said it expects three rate increases in 2017, and the benchmark 10-year rate is up nearly 100 basis points since July of last year. Rising rates aren't a crazy risk factor for solar; they're already happening today. Margins in the project development business are already under pressure, so even a small change in monetary policy could impact solar energy projects in a big way. Industry observers should keep an eye on what Yellen and Co. do with rates in coming months. They may seem like obscure policies to watch, but PURPA and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy are two major policies for the solar industry to watch in 2017. The Federal Reserve won't directly target solar, but the industry is impacted by anything the central bank does, whether rates are going up (bad) or down (good). PURPA may also become a hot topic. If FERC and state regulators are more open to changing rules in a way that negatively impacts the solar industry, it could put a damper on a big growth driver. Don't be surprised if this becomes a policy fight the industry takes on. From a volume of installation perspective, it may be even more important to win the fight for PURPA than the net metering battles the industry has waged in the last two years. The one big blow could bea reduction in the ITC, although that would require an act of Congress. Lawmakers have been largely supportive of renewable energy tax credits. But it's not out of the realm of possibility that the ITC could be bundled into a tax reform package. While the ITC isn't likely to be a public target because of the high number of jobs solar has created, there's a possibility that the ITC could get lost in Congressional horse trading. The industry will be watching any tax reform activity very closely.", "theme": "Markets & Policy", "title": "Forget Tax Credits.

{"body": " What do Gerald Ford, a fossil-fuel plant on the Houston Ship Channel, the second-largest utility in Vermont, and the California legislature have in common? They each ushered in a major national market transformation in the U.S. power sector over the last 40 years, at a rate of one per decade. And in 2016, right on schedule, that once-per-decade cycle repeated. This year, it was batteries that made a transformative advance into both the competitive and vertically integrated power markets. A quick review of how competition entered the power industry, decade by decade: With four momentous market transformations under our belts, what have we learned that can inform industry and advocates efforts on the next stage of power market design evolution including central and distributed storage? Here are five conclusions. The combination of 40 years of market transformation creating customer choice, power market competition and renewable energy are now in an interactive dance in both restructured and regulated markets around the country. Energy storage delivers the linchpin-- customers can move from synthetic 100 percent renewable energy products, as measured by annual energy use, to fully delivered, onsite renewable energy. The perception of retail choice market stagnation 15 years ago is deceiving if you ignore the quiet advance of the Silicon Valley and big-box purchasers who, this year, established the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance. In addition, with 2016 election victories in Nevada and Florida, customers and voters demonstrated that choice and solar access can be cracked open in deeply conservative, or even hostile, regulatory environments. Utilities, competitive new entrants and regulators learn from each market transformation and move more quickly with each market advancement. Consequently, exit fees from the PURPA days are recast to apply to net-metered solar customers, while power industry veterans working in solar look two chess moves further out to set up the ultimate threat: adding energy storage to solar systems and disconnecting load from the utility cash register, otherwise known as the grid. Over time, cost per kilowatt-hour inevitably declines for mass-manufactured technologies driven by cycles of learning and economies of scale in capital expense, supply chain and distribution. Lower costs drive demand up, revving up the virtuous cycle of manufacturing scale, lower cost and higher demand.  However, equally important is the other side of the mass-manufacturing technology coin -- the price axiom. A mass-manufactured product is generated by factories using multiple shifts per day, every day of the year, to allocate capital costs. Thus, a perturbation in demand will drop prices first to try to maintain factory utilization. The result can be abrupt and stunning to power market participants unfamiliar with technology price cycles. During the third quarter of 2016, solar modules saw prices plummet by a third, devastating the earnings of solar manufacturers and driving accelerated development in emerging solar markets. And that wasnt the first time -- nor the last well see that pricing dynamic. The same effect will be seen in batteries. Both the consumer device and electric vehicle markets will dominate battery sales volumes for the next several years relative to stationary storage serving the grid or buildings. Thus, theoretically, a perturbation in EV battery demand a few years from now will quickly and potentially radically change stationary storage prices. This point is the inevitable amalgamation of each of the points above. The velocity of market change is now determined by customer demand and how that relates to supply. Regulators operating on a schedule of years per proceeding end up playing catch-up after customers are already into the adoption curve. For example, in a recent AES/IPL filing at FERC over MISO storage tariffs, market participants argue that MISOs market rules are ineffective for deriving the full benefit from storage technology. This case reinforces the check-out-the-neighbors dynamics of the U.S. power markets. Laggard markets will be pulled toward the positive outcomes in the leading markets by the demands of customers and suppliers who can look across arbitrary market boundary fences. So what do these conclusions suggest for the latest of our decadal market transformations? Energy storage will come to power markets faster than you think. Why? Because storage markets build on the results and learning from prior market transformations. They use mass-manufactured technology that is scaling rapidly due to demand in other segments. Thus, storage adoption will push the regulatory community to catch up. It will also challenge the industry and advocacy communities to organize and coordinate -- not just soon, today! Fundamentally, energy storage will move quickly because customers want it now as prices are hitting the competitive price sweet spot in todays bids and tomorrows planning exercises. Energy storage is a resource that utilities and grid operators intuitively understand: Imagine pumped hydro that you can use anytime, anywhere, at any scale! The response: Can I order it today?! End-use customers, transmission and distribution planners, utilities with goals to serve the EV charging market, will all drive rapid energy storage market adoption.  Thanks to battery supply dynamics, which contrast sharply with the solar market a decade ago, stationary storage market adoption drafts behind two other large and fast growing markets: consumer devices and electric vehicles. Todays leading battery manufacturers are large, well-funded companies that can scale manufacturing without pushing an IPO through Wall Streets pipeline, as was necessary for small-scale solar companies. Yes, the exact form factor of the battery pack may differ between market segments, but not enough to keep suppliers from pivoting within a quarter or so to move supply between segments to align with customer demand. Thanks to 40 years of market transformation experience, we are well on our way to the inevitable dominance of renewable energy -- not just in new capacity additions, but in the percent of annual energy consumption in the power sector. Regardless of which party is in control of congress, the White House or the governors office, markets advance as customers seek to meet their preferences for affordable, clean, reliable power. Attempting to squash customers choices leads to backlashes like those in Nevada and Florida. With energy storage, utilities and regulators have the experience to decide how to harness the opportunities that storage offers as incumbents navigate a path toward the next transformation, expected in 2026. *** Julie Blunden serves as the board chair for CalCEF Catalyst and CalCharge, an executive in residence at the University of Colorado Denver's Business School's Global Energy Management Program, and advises clients through her consulting practice.

{"body": " Over the past five years or so, Encycle has been putting its swarm logic technology to use in optimizing one of the built environments dumbest pieces of equipment -- rooftop air conditioning units. To date, its done this by adding networked sensors and controllers to these units, then managing them via the startups patentedadaptive duty cycle algorithms, to get them to shift their on-off cycles to save energy, limit peak energy and take part in demand response programs. But in the past year, the Toronto-based startup, formerly known as Regen, has expanded its swarm logic platform to Wi-Fi-equipped thermostats and building management systems (BMS). Its also rolling up its combined technology offering in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering, dubbed Energy as a Service by Encycle, or EASE for short. To fund this next stage of growth, Encycle announced this week that it has raised the first tranche of a planned $11.5 million venture capital round. The round was led by new investor Prelude Ventures and previous investor NGEN Partners. Previous investors BDC, Duke Ventures, Export Development Canada and EnerTech Capital also participated. The new funding comes on top of a $7 million Series B round in 2014, along with earlier investment of roughly $15 million. The first tranche, of $7.5 million, will go toward supporting the rollout of Encycles new EASE platform to existing customers, which now account for about 35 million square feet of industrial and commercial space, as well as preparing for the commercial launch of its new thermostat and BMS integration offerings in mid-2017, CEO Robert Chiste said in an interview. With its SaaS offering, Encycle will be moving away from making money by selling its rooftop AC control devices directly to customers and charging them ongoing maintenance fees, and replacing it with a services model that will cost customers much less upfront, he said. Were charging on a very different basis, he said. Customers can get that device installed at little or no cost, in exchange for paying Encycle a monthly subscription fee. Encycle will be working with financing partners and channel partners to cover the up-front costs, he said. In return for signing up for the service, customers can reap the benefits of improved energy efficiency and demand charge management, he said. These have led to typical savings of 30 to 40 percent in AC-related energy costs, according to results from its existing customers that have been verified by the energy analytics software provider Nexant, he said. Encycle's devices are networked via wireless mesh on rooftops, and communicate via cellular networks to the companys cloud management platform. Some big existing customers include Sears department stores, Dave & Buster's restaurants, movie theater chains and distribution warehouses. The common trait among them is that they have buildings with big, flat roofs with lots of AC units, usually 10 or more, that provide a fallow field for energy savings, Chiste said. With its new funding, however, were moving into two different devices\" that will expand Encycle's addressable market, he said. The first is its SwarmStat offering for wireless thermostats. Encycle announced Honeywell as its first partner last month, and has since added the Carrier Connect thermostat, using an application programming interface (API) developed by its internet-of-things partner Ayla, he said. These commercial and industrial thermostats typically control three to five rooftop AC units at fast-food restaurants, retail stores and other smaller buildings, usually by sending them signals to turn on and off en masse. Encycles software takes readings every 5 to 15 minutes, and then analyzes that data to fine-tune thermostat settings in ways that will smooth out the AC unit operation, avoiding the sudden spikes in electricity usage that can lead to excessive demand charges and wasted energy, he said. Encycle has three buildings testing out the SmartStat technology right now. Initial data indicates that they can yield 15 to 30 percent savings in consumption and demand-related energy costs, said Chiste -- although he added that those results have not been put through the strict measurement and verification process that have proven out its direct rooftop AC control savings. Even so, connecting to existing thermostats will be a lot cheaper than installing devices on each rooftop unit, he said. Encycle can also offer customers with lots of different buildings the ability to monitor and control them as a fleet -- we can schedule 500 stores with the push of a button. While SmartStat can address smaller buildings, Encycles third new offering can connect to larger, multi-story buildings by tapping directly into their building management systems, Chiste said. While the typical BMS can do simple scheduling and temperature setpoints, Encycle is working on tapping their data to enable them to synchronize the operation of their AC units, without adding sensors to each unit, he said. Right now the startup is able to integrate with four different BMS vendors platforms, and expects to bring that technology to market in mid-2017, he said. Its working with a few channel partners, including one that its publicly announced -- BCC Japan, Ltd. -- which is working with Asahi Shokuhin, one of Japans leading food and beverage producers, best known in the U.S. for its beer. Beyond energy, Encycles platform can deliver valuable data on how well each AC unit is performing, and whether they need to be tuned up -- a service the startup has wrapped into what it calls HVAC assessment reports. There are pretty good figures out there on the maintenance costs on a per square foot basis for keeping rooftop AC units running, he said. Weve heard back from customers that with the visibility were providing, were saving them 10 to 20 percent of that. [] It has turned into a very important part of our business. On the demand response side of things, Encycle inked a partnership with Enbala in August, helped along by Chistes role as board chairman for the Vancouver, Canada-based startup. Enbala has built out a roster of customers using its platform to turn industrial pumps, refrigerators and other large energy-consuming devices into grid assets, and could tap Encycles technology to reach smaller-scale assets, Chiste said. Encycle is far from the only company offering technology to monitor, analyze and improve the energy efficiency of building HVAC systems, of course. Heating and cooling represent the largest energy consumption in the built environment, making them a target for technologies ranging from large-scale BMS optimization to wireless control systems for small commercial and residential sites. Even so, Chiste sees a big market for Encycles low-cost, high-value approach to energy optimization. We calculate there are about 2 million buildings that we can target with the combination of direct rooftop AC controls, thermostats and BMS integration, he said. The company is also not shy about protecting what it sees as its intellectual property rights over the core concepts behind its swarm logic approach, as its September 2015 patent infringement lawsuit against rival startup eCurv indicates.", "theme": "Smart Homes/Smart Buildings", "title": "Encycle Is Raising $11.5M to Bring Its Energy-Saving Swarm Logic to the Cloud", "comments": "0", "tags": ["bms", "demand management", "demand response", "enbala", "encycle", "energy efficiency", "energy management", "hvac", "rooftop ac", "smart thermostat", "venture capital"]}
{"body": " Washington Post: Scientists ConfirmThat Warm Ocean Water Is Melting the Biggest Glacier in East Antarctica Scientists at institutions in the United States and Australia on Friday published a set of unprecedented ocean observations near the largest glacier of the largest ice sheet in the world: TottenGlacier in East Antarctica. And the result was a troubling confirmation of what scientists already feared -- Totten is melting from below. The measurements, sampling ocean temperatures in seas over a kilometer (0.62 miles) deep in some places right at the edge of Totten Glaciers floating ice shelf, affirmed that warm ocean water is flowing in toward the glacier at the rate of 220,000 cubic meters per second. These waters, the paper asserts, are causing the ice shelf to lose between 63 billion and 80 billion tons of its mass to the ocean per year, and to lose about 10 meters (32 feet) of thickness annually, a reduction that has been previously noted based on satellite measurements. Bloomberg: Trumps Wolves May Gather Around Obamas Energy Nursery The Energy Departments research-and-development arm puts a modern spin on an old debate. The question may no longer be should the government help promising precommercial cleantech, but should the government help promising precommercial cleantech when the legacy energy system is threatening the long-term stability of global climate? All this as American politics is even more polarized than it was when ARPA-E was born a decade ago. Brookings Institute: Another Clinton-Trump Divide? Low-Carbon vs. High-Carbon America To be sure, its not new to suggest that Clinton-voting blue states might be more ideologically sympathetic to President Obamas strong carbon-reduction agenda than Trump-voting red states. However, what is striking...is the extremely tight alignment between states emissions and politics preferences. This alignment shows how very strongly economic self-interest shapes and reinforces ideology. The New Yorker (Opinion): Rex Tillersons State of Denial Is there such a thing as a non-denial denialist? This question came to mind this week, when Donald Trump nominated the chairman of ExxonMobil, Rex Tillerson, to be the next Secretary of State. Several news outlets gave Tillerson credit for at least acknowledging that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, a fact that was already considered established science in the Victorian era. The Washington Post noted that Tillersons position -- that climate change is not a hoax invented by the Chinese -- is more nuanced than that of many other of Trumps appointees, and in the context of how Trumps administration is shaping up on energy and environmental policy, could almost be called moderate. The Times editorial board went so far as to praise Tillerson for having reversed ExxonMobils long history of funding right-wing groups that denied the threat of global warming, and suggested that he might convince Mr. Trump not to pull out of the Paris climate accord. All of which goes to show that Tillerson is smart enough to have positioned himself, and repositioned his company, so that theres now at least confusion about where he stands.

With Tesla since 2009, Jaramillo spoke at GTM's Energy Storage Summit earlier this month. Here are a few excerpts from the conversation. \"Maybe it's our perspective informed from the vehicle side, but as Carla Peterman, one of the commissioners here in the California [Public Utilities] Commission likes to say, electric vehicles are the gateway device for energy literacy. Everybody can tell you what the price of gas is for their conventional car -- and almost nobody can tell you what the marginal price of electricity is that they pay in their home. But, when they switch over to an electric vehicle, guess what? They know exactly what rate tariff they're on, they know exactly what their options are available to them, and they start to take on these other activities like energy efficiency and solar and other stuff. I think with that sort of mind shift, you do get people who want just an easy, reliable, integrated experience.\" \"The energy market dynamics will certainly shift. The network operators, however, are not going away anytime soon. The natural monopoly function, and that regulated natural monopoly function is also not going away.\" \"That's sort of the beauty of the 50 state laboratories that we have, different models pursuing different paths. Texas being an energy-only market, Germany looks a lot like Texas. It's probably the only way in which Germany looks a lot like Texas, [with] highly competitive retail markets, highly competitive generation markets, and then sort of established network operators. The state of Texas has done some good things to really incentivize renewables, and the output, and specifically transmission build-out. The result is that, of course, they have a lot of renewables, and now you're seeing merchant solar come for the first time in a major way in any U.S. market. I think that a lot of states are looking at Texas.\" \"The important thing to keep in mind is that energy storage will participate no matter what the structure of the market is. No matter what path on regulation is taken, you can come up with a solution that works for incorporating energy storage because it provides value to the market.\" Prior to Tesla, Jaramillo was COO at Gaia Power Technologies.

As Jeff St. John just reported, \"After years of fighting over the details of Pacific Gas & Electrics plan to bring up to 7,500 electric-vehicle chargers to Northern California, EV-charging providers and consumer and environmental groups are praising a new compromise plan that has just received approval from state regulators. On Thursday, the five-member California Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved a decision directing PG&E to move ahead with what will be the countrys largest utility-led EV charging deployment.\" We believe that the commission accurately reflected our concerns on competition and customer choice, said Smart, adding, \"This really does create a national model that other utilities and states should look at.\" California currently leads the country in electric vehicle ownership, and Gov. Jerry Brown has set a goal to have 1.5 million EVs on the road by 2025. Jed Dorsheimer, previously a lighting market analyst with Canaccord Genuity, is now VP of the commercial office vertical at Acuity Brands. Way back in 2009, Acuity bought Sensor Switch, a maker of motion-controlled and programmable sensors, for about $205 million. Acuity Brands also bought Lighting Control and Design, a maker of light-dimming devices, digital thermostats and related software. Adura Technologies, a startup in the networked lighting space, was acquired by Acuity Brands in 2013. Acuity also purchased eldoLED, a maker of LED driver electronics, in 2013, and acquired Distech Controls, a maker of energy management and building controls, for approximately $252 million, in 2015. Acuity now has about 15 brands under its roof, all involved in some aspect of the lighting ecosystem. ***  Enertech Search Partners, an executive search firm with a dedicated cleantech practice, is the sponsor of the GTM jobs column.

From the previous jobs column: Steven Chan is the new CEO at inverter firm Sungrow North America. Chan has had executive stints at Suntech, Andalay Solar, NRG Residential Solar and GCL Solar Energy. In July of this year, Sungrow allied with Samsung SDI in a joint energy storage effort. London-based Telensa, a maker of networked LED street lighting with smart city applications, named Will Franks as CEO. The firm provides connectivity and control for over a million streetlights worldwide, competing against firms such as Silver Spring Networks, Current/GE and Philips. In January 2016, the company raised $18 million in equity and debt from Environmental Technologies Fund and Silicon Valley Bank.   SolarCity has started the hiring process for its $900 million solar module factory in Buffalo, New York by holding \"workforce information sessions\" in advance of hiring 1,460 workers, 500 in manufacturing jobs starting at $12.50 an hour, according to reports by local TV news station WGRZ. But according to The Buffalo News, the hiring is happening \"amid recent scandal that contractors working on the Tesla-SolarCity plant in Riverbend have not been paid by the state since September. This comes after New York state officials said payments have been held up because of extra scrutiny they are receiving in the wake of the corruption charges that have been filed over the process used to select the general contractor for the SolarCity project.\"", "theme": "Grid Edge", "title": "Energy Jobs: Mateo Jaramillo Leaves Tesla, John Woolard Exits Google, Plus ChargePoint, Acuity, More", "comments": "0", "tags": ["acuity brands", "chargepoint", "energy jobs", "enertech search", "enertechsearch", "google", "green jobs", "jobs", "john woolard", "mateo jaramillo", "tesla"]}
{"body": " The energy storage asset class puts a single label on a dizzying variety of technologies and applications. It's hard to compare a cavern full of pumped air with a lithium-ion battery, even if they perform similar functions. This makes it difficult to gauge progress across the entire industry. The financial analysts at Lazard make it easier with their Levelized Cost of Storage Analysis, the second annual installment of which was released Thursday. They standardized costs for 10 prevailing storage technologies to show how they stack up for 10 particular use cases. The picture that emerges is of an ecosystem of technologies rapidly trending down in cost, especially for the larger-scale projects. The old grid-scale stalwarts, pumped hydro and compressed air, still beat the newcomers on cost, but the advanced technologies are closing the gap quickly, and they can operate in many more settings. Lazard's model takes data from storage manufacturers and developers to determine the levelized cost of storage for a particular use, and then compares that with the best available incumbent alternative. The model steers clear of systematically determining value, a most elusive quality that changes from place to place. For instance, pumped hydro boasts a very low price per megawatt-hour, ranging from $152 to $198 in this report. That won't make it competitive, though, for a project in the middle of a flat desert, where there's no pumpable body of water to use. This report gives the cost and lets users apply that to their own use cases, and offers a few value snapshots at the end. Outside of those snapshots, the authors steer clear of modeling \"value stacking,\" the strategy employed by storage vendors when any single use doesn't make economic sense. However, readers with data on the stacked values of a storage application can compare it to the levilzed cost of storage (LCOS) to determine if it makes financial sense. The researchers at Lazard have been tinkering away since last year to upgrade their storage model. They've narrowed the LCOS ranges, better tailored the use cases to real-world applications, divvied up the flow batteries category into the different key technologies and included costs in terms of power, not just energy. The changes in methodology require caution in making one-to-one comparisons with the previous edition of the study, because not all of the categories mean the same things now.  Source: Lazard's Levelized Cost of Storage Analysis 2.0 The use cases examined will be familiar to storage industry observers. In front of the meter: transmission assistance, peaker replacement, frequency regulation, distribution substation and distribution feeder. Behind the meter: microgrids, island grids, commercial and industrial systems, commercial appliance (sized smaller, not meant for grid services) and residential. Lithium-ion costs have dropped noticeably since last year's report. For peaker plant replacement, which holds tremendous potential both for decarbonizing the grid and reducing overall capital costs, lithium-ion now ranges from $285 to $581 per megawatt-hour; last year it was $321 to $658 per megawatt-hour. That's a 12 percent drop in the median cost in one year. Lithium-ion also fell 24 percent for the transmission use case and 11 percent for residential. Its lowest-cost use is for frequency regulation, where the minimum cost fell from $211 per megawatt-hour last year to $190 per megawatt-hour. The cost ranges for flow batteries got more expensive since last year but also tightened, reflecting a more precise modeling of reality. The range for flow batteries in peaker displacement and transmission last year exceeded $600 per megawatt-hour. This year that range was considerably reduced; zinc-bromine flow batteries have the most precise range, $434 to $549 per megawatt-hour for transmission and $448 to $563 for peaker replacement. That reflects the ongoing maturation of this technology and the increase in available data on it.  Source: Lazard's Levelized Cost of Storage Analysis 2.0 Lazard and partner Enovation predict capital cost declines will continue across the board in the next five years, with the strongest declines in lead acid batteries, lithium-ion energy applications, sodium and long-duration flywheels. The vanadium flow batteries clock in with an impressive 24 percent average predicted cost decline as well. Overall, the industry still has a lot of work to do. There's a clear trend of the costs being lower across the board for bigger-scale projects: median costs for transmission projects are lower than distribution projects, which are lower than residential. That's to be expected given economies of scale, but it creates an ongoing challenge for all of those residential vendors trying to convince homeowners to buy. That's not all bad for residential suppliers, though. Cost parity with incumbent technologies can be reached more quickly on the grid-scale side, and the supply chain work there should also lower capital costs for smaller storage applications. In other words, residential storage benefits from the industry's overall success.", "theme": "Energy Storage", "title": "Storage Costs Come Down Across Technologies and Applications According to Lazard Report", "comments": "21", "tags": ["batteries", "caes", "flow batteries", "lazard", "lithium-ion", "pumped hydro", "storage"]}
