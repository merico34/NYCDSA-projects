## **Exploratory Data Analysis - Hubway Trips**

This project focuses on the exploratory analysis and visualization of the Hubway “Trip History” dataset, collected from bike share stations from 2011-2013. External datasets from public sources, such as Boston zipcode/neighborhood information, were also used.

Analysis and presentation is done in the following files:

1) **hubway_analysis.R** - data import, processing and visualization

2) **ggplot_theme.R** - helper ggplot theme for consistent graphing

3) **EDA_hubway.rmd** - R markdown file with presentation and code chunks which can be knit to HTML using knitr
